# DAY 214 Barbados decides to dump the queen
1 When sandra mason gave her annual “throne speech” to open Barbados’s Parliament on September 15th, she proposed the abolition of her own job. As the country’s governor-general she represents Queen Elizabeth II, its head of state. From November next year, in time for the 55th anniversary of independence from Britain, Barbados will be a republic, Dame Sandra declared. “The time has come to fully leave our colonial past behind,” she said. “Barbadians want a Barbadian head of state.”

2 Barbados is one of nine Caribbean countries in which the queen fills that role. She also does in Australia, Canada, New Zealand and three Pacific islands. Like other Caribbean people, many Bajans, as Barbadians are also known, find it odd that their ceremonial leader is a white woman who lives an ocean away, however much they like her. Some of the **monarchy’s** symbols make them **queasy**. The governor-general is Dame Grand Cross of the Order of St Michael and St George, whose badge depicts a white-skinned angel stomping on a **prostrate** black-skinned Satan.

3 Dame Sandra pronounced the words but their author was Barbados’s prime minister, Mia Mottley. Her Barbados Labour Party has all but one of the 30 elected seats in the lower house of Parliament. Ms Mottley will have no problem mustering the two-thirds majority in both houses needed to dump the monarchy. She has not yet made clear ho w Barbados will choose its future head of state.

4 Many former British colonies have contemplated the republican idea, only to discover that it is hard to execute. Barbados dithered for nearly a quarter of a century. A constitutional commission proposed in 1998 that the country become a republic. Successive governments promised **referendums** to confirm public support for the idea, but never held one. Ms Mottley does not think she needs a referendum to get her republic, and is not constitutionally required to hold one.

5 Other Caribbean monarchies have flirted with republicanism without embracing it. Jamaica’s prime minister, Andrew Holness, proposed a referendum before his election in 2016. He won a second term this month, campaigning on a **manifesto** that merely promises “consultations” on the issue. Ralph Gonsalves, of St Vincent & the Grenadines, is the only Caribbean prime minister to have held a referendum on adopting a republican form of government. He campaigned for the change in 2009, and lost.

6 The many u-turns on republicanism are due to the fact that replacing the monarch with a president involves unpicking a country’s constitution. Governors-general are formally appointed in London, but are in fact chosen by the prime minister. But a prime minister can’t simply choose a head of state. A more democratic way must be found, but that risks giving legitimacy to someone who could become a rival. Few prime ministers want that.

7 The president of Trinidad & Tobago, which became a republic in 1976, is elected by Parliament, and has real powers. In 1997 the prime minister of the day, Basdeo Panday, backed a former one, Arthur Robinson, who became president. In an election four years later both parties won the same number of seats. It fell to Robinson to pick the winner. He chose Mr Panday’s opponent, Patrick Manning, for his “moral and spiritual values”. Furious, Mr Panday and his supporters blocked parliamentary proceedings. Fears of a similar confrontation may have led some Caribbean leaders to reconsider their support for republicanism.

8 On rare occasions governors-general can be political players. Paul Scoon, who represented the queen in Grenada in the 1980s, **cohabited** for four years with a pro-Cuban “people’s revolutionary government”. After the prime minister, Maurice Bishop, was deposed (and killed) in 1983 by someone still more radical, Scoon asked the United States, then governed by Ronald Reagan, to invade. The Americans booted out the Marxists and freed Scoon from house arrest. Dame Sandra’s remaining 14 months as the queen’s woman in Barbados are unlikely to be so eventful. ■

> 2009年11月25日，圣文森特全国举行修宪公投，主要旨在废除英国女王        伊丽莎白二世        的圣文森特国家元首地位，选择一位总统作为国家元首，同时赋予总理更大的权力。冈萨尔维斯积极倡导这项公投，并号召选民们投赞成票，他说：“我个人对伊丽莎白女王并无反感，但是我实在看不出她作为圣文森特国家元首而存在的必要”。分析人士担心，公投一旦成功，冈萨尔维斯可能拥有更多权力，并且向        委内瑞拉        总统查韦斯的集权方向发展。两位反对党领袖阿尼姆·尤斯塔斯和詹姆斯·米切尔极力反对公投内容，并号召选民投反对票。另有部分人士对公投合法性表示怀疑，本次公投的登记选民有9万多，但圣国总人口只有11万多人，另有40%的人不够选举年龄，怀疑人士认为政府可能想通过舞弊行为达到自己的目的。此外，圣外长路易斯·斯特雷克2008年刚刚访问        伊朗        ，圣国与巴西、        委内瑞拉        等拉美左派国家渐进，并接受他们的援助，有迹象显示在公投的前夕又大量美元汇入圣国，更添加了政府舞弊的可能。最终，该公投提案被否决。
