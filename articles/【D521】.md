# D521 Boris Johnson marks his second anniversary in Number 10
> **turmoil**：混乱; 骚乱
 > 

1 It feels surprising that July 24th marks only the second anniversary of Boris Johnson’s arrival at Number 10, the prime-ministerial residence: into those two years he has packed enough incident to keep another man going for two decades. He has divorced for a second time, married for a third, witnessed the birth of what is thought to be his sixth child, **contracted** covid-19 and flirted with the **Grim Reaper**. On the politics front he has **prorogued** Parliament, expelled 21 Tory **grandees** from the party for voting against the government on Brexit, lost his majority in the process, won spectacular re-election and signed a Brexit deal.

> **prorogue[proʊˈroʊɡ]**：(立法机构)休会

> **grandees**：贵族；要人；大公（西班牙或葡萄牙最高爵位）

2 What to make of this **whirling dervish**? Mr Johnson is **notoriously** a “**Marmite**” politician: fans forgive him anything; enemies regard him as a dangerous **buffoon**. The latter group now includes his former chief adviser, Dominic Cummings, who this week told the bbc that the very idea of Mr Johnson being prime minister “obviously is **ludicrous**”. He is also an **alpha**/gamma politician, to invoke the **pompous** marking scheme of his former **alma mater**, Oxford University, sometimes dazzling with political genius and at others appalling with incompetence. The question is which will **predominate** during the rest of his time in office.

3 Mr Johnson understood intuitively that the financial crisis of 2008 ended the **neoliberal** consensus. Globalisation had left too many voters behind, and created self-satisfied, self-obsessed winners. No mere Trumpian wrecking ball, he is trying to reshape globalisation in the mould of Britain’s **buccaneering maritime** past, rather than the European Union’s bureaucratic **pettifoggery**. As parties **withered** and voters became more celebrity-obsessed, he cultivated a **dishevelled bonhomie** and became a media star, ascending to the top job by way of television studios and the London mayor’s office rather than stuffy committees and the **whip’s** office.

4 But the man who can sniff the future on every changing breeze can also make the most **godawful** hash of things. He fulfilled a promise to “get Brexit done” by **blithely** agreeing to a customs border in the Irish Sea and then denying that it meant anything. He **dawdled** in his initial response to covid-19, missing the first five emergency meetings to try to sort out his personal affairs. Scandals come thick and fast, from the £200,000 ($275,000), some of it fronted by party donors, that went on redecorating his Downing Street flat to a (rapidly reversed) decision to exempt himself from isolating when told to do so by the national contact-tracing app.

5 The prime minister’s great problem—and therefore the country’s—is that the very same characteristics and conditions account for both alpha and gamma. One is an unusual tolerance for chaos. Mr Johnson was brought up in an unstable home, with an endlessly unfaithful father and a mother who had a nervous breakdown and spent months in a mental institution; the two divorced. The family moved home 32 times in his first 14 years—around the age when he transformed himself from Alexander the introverted **swot** into Boris the **Etonian** swell. In both personal and professional life he repeatedly returns to chaos as an **addict** returns to the needle. Explaining why he chose politics over a comfortable life as an author and journalist, he chose a telling metaphor: “There comes a point when you’ve got to put the **dynamite** under your own **tram tracks**…[and] derail yourself.” He has been derailing Britain ever since.

6 This tendency towards chaos is linked to two others: persistent optimism and a belief in the power of individuals (in particular, one Boris Johnson) to shape events. His sentences **ring with exuberant** words—“amazing”, “fantastic” and “splendid”—as though Sinclair Lewis’s Babbitt had swallowed a volume of P.G. Wodehouse. He loathes the common establishment **affectation** of **world-weariness**. On the matter of Scottish independence, upon which depends the very future of the United Kingdom he governs, he seems to think that the threat will **dissipate** if he does nothing. He instinctively **hews to** the “great man” theory of history, according to which figures such as Winston Churchill, about whom he has written a book, or Silvio Berlusconi, with whom he seemed **smitten** for a time, bend “**fortuna**” to their will.

7 This psychology lies behind his more inspired moves, from breaking the Conservative **impasse** over Brexit to handing the vaccine-procurement programme to a venture capitalist, Kate Bingham, with a virtually unlimited budget and permission to operate outside the usual government **strictures**. But it also lies behind his worst ones. Even his predecessor, Theresa May, who has **not a scintilla of** alpha about her, nevertheless recognised that the **conundrum** posed by the Irish border could neither be ignored nor wished away. Jeremy Hunt, who led the competition against Mr Johnson for the Conservative leadership in 2019, may not thrill the crowds like the man who defeated him. But thousands fewer might well have died in the early, chaotic phase of the pandemic if just 50,000 Conservative Party members had chosen calm competence over **tousle**-haired unpredictability.

8 **Ominously** for anyone who likes a quiet life, the **gamma grades** are becoming more numerous. Mr Johnson’s **seat-of-the-pants** approach is ill-suited to sorting and stacking the building blocks of the post-Brexit political settlement. Moreover, he seems increasingly to have fallen for his own **mythmaking**. He succeeded as London mayor by appointing a **crack team** to handle administration while he **hogged** the **limelight**. But as prime minister he has failed to **delegate**, first falling for the grenade-throwing Mr Cummings and latterly acting like the king of a **faction-ridden** court. In testimony to a parliamentary select committee on covid-19 in May, Mr Cummings recalled complaining about the chaotic handling of the pandemic. “Chaos isn’t that bad,” Mr Johnson replied, in Mr Cummings’s retelling. “Chaos means that everyone has to look to me to see who’s in charge.”
