1 Until recently the ear was a part of the body relatively unconquered by commerce. The neck long ago fell to the necklace, the **ruff** and the tie. The wrist surrendered to the bracelet and the watch. The eye sold out to spectacles, shades and **mascara**. But the ears were a **low-rent** zone for business, good mostly for cheap jewellery, earphones and hearing aids. Walk around any big city and it is clear how quickly that is changing—thanks to headphones, earbuds and a torrent of new stuff blaring through them.

> 一直到最近为止，相比于身体的其他部分，耳朵都未被商业征服。很早以前，脖子就戴上了项链、皱领和领带；手腕臣服于手镯和手表；而眼睛则用上了眼镜、墨镜和睫毛膏。但是耳朵对于商业来说，一直以来就是低热度区，最多也就是一些便宜的珠宝、耳机和助听器。如今，走在任何大城市，都可以很清晰地感受到这种现象已经发生了变化，这多亏了头戴式耳机、耳塞式耳机以及通过这些耳机传播的大量新事物。

2 Apple, as usual, caught the trend early. The number of its AirPods, mocked for looking like broken q-tips when introduced in 2016, is estimated to have doubled to 60m pairs this year. They have **spawned** a wave of imitators, from Amazon’s black Echo Buds to Xiaomi’s Airdots (popular in China) and Microsoft’s Surface Earbuds—which **creepily** link directly to its Office software, including PowerPoint. The devices grow symbiotically with another craze: for streamed audio content in addition to music, such as podcasts. Apple helped popularise this genre. But Spotify, a Swedish streaming service, and big American broadcasting **conglomerates**, such as Liberty Media, are muscling in.

> 一如既往，苹果公司很早就抓住了这一趋势。16年AirPods刚发布时，被嘲笑说长得和断了的棉棒一样，今年AirPods的数量估计已经翻了一番达到6000万。AirPods的问世引发了模仿浪潮：从亚马逊的黑色Echo Buds耳机到小米的Airdots（在中国很火），还有微软的Surface Earbuds——这一款耳机神奇地直接连到Office办公软件，包括PPT。与耳机设备同生共长的的另一波狂热，是除了音乐之外的音频流内容，如播客。苹果公司助力了这一音频类型的推广。然而瑞典的流媒体音乐服务平台Spotify和美国的广播集团Liberty Media也在竞争这一市场。

3 Industry executives contend that audio is undervalued—especially compared with video. As Spotify’s co-founder, Daniel Ek, said earlier this year, time spent on each is about the same, but the video industry is worth $1trn versus $100bn for audio. “Are our eyes really worth ten times more than our ears?” he asks.

> 行业领导者认为音频被低估了它的价值，尤其和视频相比。Spotify的联合创始人丹尼尔·易年初的时候说，人们在音频和视频上花相同的时间，但视频行业可以赚一万亿美元，而音频只可以赚一千亿。因此丹尼尔发问，“我们的眼睛真的比我们的耳朵价值高十倍吗”。

4 The eyeball plainly still **dominates**. The number of screens dwarfs that of “hearables”. Between them, just three Tinseltown groups—Warner Media, Disney and Netflix—have spent as much as $250bn on visual programming since 2010. Audio, including music, comes nowhere near. That said, the battle to “**monetise** the ear”, as Greg Maffei, Liberty Media’s boss, puts it, is in full swing. These days no one would lend Mark Antony theirs; they would rent or sell them.

> 眼睛显而易见地仍然占主导地位。屏幕的数量相远高于听音设备的数量。在它们之间，仅仅三家好莱坞公司——华纳公司、迪士尼和网飞——从2010年起就花了大概2500个亿用作可视编程的开发。音频，包括音乐在內，远不及此。尽管这样，“耳朵商业化”的战争就像克雷格·马费伊，Liberty Media的领导者说的那样，正如火如荼地进行。最近没人愿意把他们自己的借给马克·安东尼，人们更愿意租借或者卖掉它们。

5 Take hardware first. Apple does not release figures for any of its “wearables”, but AirPods are the fastest-growing of all of its products, with profit margins above 50%, says Dan Ives of Wedbush Securities, an investment firm. With the new noise-cancelling AirPods Pro, which costs around $250 a pair, he reckons Apple’s ear-ware may generate up to $15bn of sales next year. That would be about four times the revenues of a headphone veteran like Bose. Horace Dediu, a technology analyst, predicts that this quarter AirPods sales could exceed those of the iPod at its peak around Christmas 2007. With iPhone sales slowing, AirPods are a new way of generating revenue from Apple’s legions of loyalists; they even allow Siri, the company’s voice-activated virtual assistant, to worm her way closer to listeners’ brains. The overall market is spreading to the masses, too. Some wireless earbuds sell for as little as $20.

> 首先来谈谈硬件，苹果公司从未公布任何可穿戴的设备的数据，但是据调研公司韦德布什的丹·艾维斯透露，AirPods的利润高达50%，在所有的产品里是增长最快的。随着售价250美金一对的降噪版AirPod Pro问世，他认为苹果的耳机佩戴部门可能在明年产生高达150亿美金，是像Bose这样的耳机老品牌销售额的四倍。技术分析师贺拉斯·德迪尤，预计这个季度AirPods的销量可能会超过2007年圣诞期间iPod创下的销量纪录。随着iPhone销量下滑，AirPods是一个从苹果大量忠实粉丝中产生利润的新途径；苹果甚至让自己的声控虚拟助手Siri去赢得听取者的欢心。整体市场也在向大众市场延伸，有些无线耳机甚至售价低至20美金。

6 Audible content is likewise undergoing a mini-revolution. For the third year in a row, revenues from recorded music in America grew by double digits in 2018, largely thanks to subscriptions to Spotify, Apple Music and the like. Podcasts have grown both more numerous and more compelling. This year Spotify has set out to rule the **roost** in this medium, which Apple first streamed via iTunes in the mid-2000s. The Swedish firm acquired Gimlet, Anchor and Parcast, three firms that serve different aspects of the podcast market; it now hosts a staggering 500,000 podcasts; hours spent listening to them grew by 39% year-on-year in the third quarter. In October it boasted that the conversion of podcast listeners to paying subscribers is “almost too good to be true”.

> 音频内容同样地在经历一个小的变革。连着三年，2018年的美国录制音乐销售收入也以两位数增长，这主要归功于诸如Spotify和苹果音乐这样的会员会费。播客也成长得更加强大和令人叹服。苹果在2000年代中期通过iTunes成为首屈一指的媒介，今年 Spotify也计划在这一媒介物上称雄。这家瑞典公司买下了Gimlet、Anchor 和Parcast这三家为播客市场提供各种服务公司，现在拥有令人震惊的50万个播客。听这些播客的小时数与去年相比在第三季度增长39%。在十月，他们扬言说，从播客收听者转换成付费订阅者的人数“多得令人难以置信”。

7 The battleground stretches beyond earbuds to the car radio. On December 12th the Wall Street Journal reported that Siriusxm, a satellite-radio arm of Liberty Media, had sought clearance from the Department of Justice to raise its stake in iHeartMedia, America’s largest radio broadcaster and a big podcasting platform. The aim would be to compete more effectively against Spotify and other audio-streaming services both for subscribers and advertising revenues. Previously Mr Maffei has talked excitedly about podcasting.

> 市场的硝烟从耳机弥漫到了车载音响。12月12日的华尔街日报说Liberty Media的卫星广播Siriusxm为了提高在美国的大型无线电广播和大型播客平台iHeartMedia的股份，正在努力得到司法部的官方认可。这件事的目标是为了与Spotify及其他音频流服务商更有效地竞争，争夺会费和广告收入。很久以前，马费依先生就曾激动的讨论过这个播客市场。

8 The proliferation of digital-streaming devices has spawned the growth of other listening formats. This year, for the first time, the Audio Publishers Association, an industry group, reported that half of Americans listened to an audiobook, a trend it said was boosted by the popularity of digital-streaming devices, as well as podcasts. Audible, owned by Amazon, is the market leader. Malcolm Gladwell, an American author and podcaster, has turned the audio version of his latest book “Talking to Strangers”, into what seems like a supersized podcast, with his own narration, actors and music. Romantics see it as a return to the oral tradition.

> 数字流设备的快速增长促进了其他音频形式的增长。今年，也是第一次，工业组织音频生产者协会报告称一半的美国人都在听有声书，并称这一趋势是由数字流设备和播客的流行带起来的。亚马逊旗下的Audible是市场的引领者。美国作家和播客马尔科姆·格拉德威尔把他的最后一本书《与陌生人交谈》的音频版本，变得像一个超大型的播客内容，包含了自己的叙事、演员和音乐。浪漫主义者把这一现象作为是口述传统的回春。

9 Though small, some of this spoken word has better economics than the sung variety. As Ben Thompson of Stratechery, a tech newsletter, has pointed out, the more music Spotify’s customers download, the more its costs rise because of payments to record labels. Podcasts are different. Spotify has more bargaining power over myriad individual podcasters jostling to reach its 248m-odd users than it does over record labels. It also buys its exclusive podcasts at a fixed cost. The problem is advertising. Ad revenues are paltry. In America **terrestrial** radio still accounts for 82% of an audio ad market valued at more than $17bn. Siriusxmand Spotify have just a sliver of the pie.

> 尽管播客市场很小但是其收益却好于音乐市场。科技简报Stratechery的作者本·汤普森指出，Spotify的用户下载越多的音乐，Spotify就会产生更多的成本，因为要付给唱片公司更多的版权费。播客就不同了，Spotify面对无数个体播客，个个都争先恐户想接触平台的2.48亿个用户，比起面对唱片公司拥有更强的议价能力。问题在于广告，因为广告收入微不足道。在美国，陆地广播仍占领着价值多于170亿美金的广播广告市场的82%。Siriusxmand和Spotify只有占据整个市场的一小部分。

10 Apple has the clout to make the industry more profitable. It could use its strong position with AirPods, Apple Music, podcasts and Siri to create a swirl of audio content around the iPhone—an ecosystem in the jargon—and take the lion’s share of advertising. For the time being, though, it appears to be more focused on creating video content, in its battle for eyeballs with Netflix. That is lucky for Spotify. It gives it a bigger opening in the audio market. It is good for listeners, too. The last thing anyone wants is a Big Tech behemoth controlling the next best thing to a brain implant.

> 苹果对让市场更有利润可赚有着很大的影响力。它可以用自身的AirPods、苹果音乐、播客和无法取代的强大市场地位来围绕iPhone创造一大批音频内容——用行话说就是一个生态系统——并且在广告收入里拿下巨大份额。当下，苹果更注重创作视频内容，在围绕眼睛的战役上和网飞进行竞争。这对Spotify是件好事。苹果公司这样做会让音频市场有更为盛大的开幕。对于听众来说也是一件好事。大家最不想要的，就是单个科技巨头控制住一切，这就仅次于大脑植入芯片了。
