# DAY 66 Listen to Bertrand Russell, the English Voltaire
1 Among many other achievements, Bertrand Russell is the only philosopher to have cut an album of his work. Released in 1962, “Bertrand Russell Speaking” was a greatest hits of the many interviews he had given. Subjects range from science and religion on side A, to “taboo morality” and “**fanaticism**” on side B. If discovered in the bedroom of a teenager of the time, the record might have seemed as **scandalous** as any rock’n’roll **track**. Because, as well as being a pioneering logician, Russell was an uncompromising freethinker—and an early advocate of free love.

2 Fifty years after his death, Russell’s voice—an **enduring** call to liberal **dissent**—is preserved on YouTube, where self-isolating listeners can find a **trove** of his words and wisdom. With an **unfailing** wit, the recordings cover mathematics, literature, atomic physics and history. Entertaining and improving at once, they are a delightful **stand-in** for the intelligent conversation you might currently be missing.

3 Russell’s personal anecdotes are a highlight. Brought up by a grandfather who was twice prime minister, he grew up in the **patrician splendour** of the Liberal establishment. Once, at a dinner, the young Russell “was left tête-à-tête” with William Gladstone, the “Grand Old Man” of British politics. “I was only 17 and very, very shy, and it was by far the worst experience of my life,” Russell recalled. “Nothing since has terrified me.” He remembered Gladstone saying only one thing: “This is very good port, but why have they given it me in a claret glass?”

4 Despite his Victorian upbringing, Russell’s views and legacy are remarkably contemporary. He once speculated that only six people had read his “Principia Mathematica”, three of whom had been murdered by Hitler; nevertheless, the book laid the early foundations of computer science. Russell helped establish the analytic tradition, which rejected grand dogmas in favour of clear and precise inquiry, and became the basis of most university philosophy courses. And he was a famously committed atheist, using his **formidable** rhetorical skills to **prosecute** that cause.

5 In a debate broadcast by the bbc in 1948 Russell came up against Frederick Copleston, a Jesuit priest, in one of the listening public’s earliest exposures to the philosophical arguments against God. Thanks to YouTube, you can listen to the stand-off again. Copleston, palpably irritated and wearied by his opponent’s **obstinance**, **pleads**: “We seem to have reached an **impasse**.” “We can press the point a little I think,” Russell **cheekily** replies.

6 On his death, Russell was **eulogised** as “the English Voltaire”, a witty, **polymathic** rebel. As with Voltaire, though a few of his books are still in publication, most now gather dust. But through the **alchemy** of the internet, his voice lives on. One appreciative listener has commented: “Imagine if this guy had a podcast.” The informal online archive will have to suffice. ■

7 Three passions, simple but overwhelmingly strong, have governed my life: the longing for love ,the search for knowledge, and unbearable pity for the suffering of mankind. These passions, like great winds, have blown me hither and thither, in a wayward course, over a deep ocean of anguish, reaching to the very verge of despair.

8 I have sought love, first, because it brings ecstasy -- ecstasy so great that I would often have sacrificed all the rest of life for a few hours of this joy. I have sought it , next, because it relieves loneliness-- that terrible loneliness in which one shivering consciousness looks over the rim of the world , into the cold unfathomable lifeless abyss. I have sought it, finally, because in the union of love I have seen, in a mystic miniature, the prefiguring vision of the heaven that saints and poets have imagined. This is what I sought, and though it might seem too good for human life, this is what -- at last -- I have found.

9 With equal passion I have sought knowledge. I have wished to understand the hearts of men. I have wished to know why the stars shine. And I have tried to apprehend the Pythagorean power by which number holds sway above the flux. A little of this, but not much I have achieved.

10  Love and knowledge , so far as they were possible, led upward toward the heavens. But always pity brought me back to earth. Echoes of cries of pain reverberate in my heart. Children in famine, victims tortured by oppressors, helpless old people a hated burden to their sons, and the whole world of loneliness, poverty, and pain make a mockery of what human life should be. I long to alleviate the evil, but I cannot, and I too suffer.

> This has been my life. I have found it worth living, and would gladly live it again if the chance were offered me.
