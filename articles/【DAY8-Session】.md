# DAY 8-Session 2 Creepy crawlies
> **Halfway through** “Parasite” the Kims  (pictured), a family of grifters who live in a **dank** Seoul **basement**, have by **hook and (mostly) crook wangled** their way into jobs in the **ultrachic** mansion of the Parks.

> Twisty as the plot has already been, viewers know more surprises must be in store—but can scarcely imagine what they will be. The
 > 
> **screwball** shifts in tone somehow **cohere into** a biting parable of haves and havenots. On February 9th this South Korean farce became the first foreign-language film to be crowned Best Picture at the Academy Awards. It also took Best Screenplay, Best International Feature Film and Best Director, for Bong Joon-ho.
 > 
> “Once you overcome the one-inch tall barrier of subtitles,” Mr Bong has observed, “you will be introduced to many more amazing films.” The success of “Parasite” has been seen as a **harbinger** of the rise of
 > 
> global cinema in the **Anglophone** world, and of South Korea’s rich film industry in particular. Perhaps—but, even more than usual, it is a triumph for Mr Bong, who has completed a high-speed journey from **subversive** extremist to national hero. During the administration of Park Geun-hye, from 2013 to 2017, officials kept tabs on him because of his politics; state funding was unavailable for his work. Being blacklisted in this way, Mr Bong said just three years ago, was a “nightmare”. On February 10th he received a warm congratulatory message from Moon Jae-in, the president today.
 > 
> His **rehabilitation chimes with** political changes in South Korea. Ms Park’s **lieutenants** considered Mr Bong’s films—which include “Memories of Murder”, “Mother” and “Okja”—unacceptably disrespectful of the state; more than 9,000 other artists and
 > 
> writers, many less able to support themselves, got the same treatment. (Mr Bong’s English-language sci-fi **flick**, “Snowpiercer", faced a different problem in America: Harvey Weinstein’s distribution firm restricted its release when Mr Bong refused to make the cuts Mr Weinstein wanted.) In the end, the cultural **McCarthyism** did not

> help its **enforcers.** A newspaper revealed the existence of the blacklist in 2016; the resulting **outrage** contributed to Ms Park’s **impeachment** and eventual imprisonment for corruption and abuse of power, and the

 > 
> Some **conservatives** are still **wary** of Mr Bong, whose work criticises capitalism and social **hierarchies**. But despite its themes of inequality and **class resentment**, South Koreans’ **jubilation** over “Parasite” transcended politics. The many who had been breathlessly following the Oscars ceremony **erupted** in pride when the best-picture envelope was opened. Cinemas swiftly added new screenings for the few **laggards** who had not yet seen the film (more than 10m tickets were sold when it was shown in South Korea last summer). A pizza joint

> and supermarket that feature in the story were overrun by reporters. The **municipal** government promoted tours of the film’s locations, including a **grimy** underpass.
 > 
> Little good the **enthusiasm** will do the city’s strugglers—at least, if “Parasite” itself is any guide. Nothing **avails** the Kims, neither crime nor (when they try it) going straight. Still, for all its fatalism, part of the
 > 
> appeal of Mr Bong’s zany movie is that it is never simplistic. The Kims aren’t saints, and the Parks are more **blithe** than **villainous**; they just cannot help noticing the odour that seems to emanate from the servants. If audiences stop to think about it, the grisly denouement is only a slight inflection of a reality in which, sometimes, the poorest are left to feed on **scraps**.
