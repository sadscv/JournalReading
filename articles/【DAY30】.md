1 In 2007 more humans lived in cities than outside them for the first time. It was a transition 5,000 years in the making. The internet has been quicker to reach the halfway mark. Over 50% of the planet’s population is now online, a mere quarter of a century after the web first took off among **tech-savvy** types in the West. The second half of the internet revolution has begun. As our briefing describes, it is changing how society works—and also creating a new business **puzzle**.

> 2007年，城市人口首次超过了非城市人口。这个转变历时5000年。与之相比，网民数超过非网民的速度更快。最初网络只在西方精英中风靡，如今网络席卷全球一半以上的人口，历时却仅25年。互联网第二次革命已然开始。正如我们简报所述，此次革命正在改变社会的运作方式，同时也在创造新的商业难题。

2 Most new users are in the emerging world; some 726m people came online in the past three years alone. China is still growing fast. But much of the rise is coming from poorer places, notably India and Africa. Having seen what fake news and **trolling** has done to public discourse in rich countries, many observers worry about politics being **debased**, from the polarization of India’s electorate to the **persecution** of Myanmar’s Rohingya minority.

> 大多数新网民都来自新兴国家。仅在过去3年中，网民人数就增加7.26亿人。中国的网民数仍在快速增长。不过大部分网民来自更落后的地区，以印度和非洲为最。发达国家的公共话语曾经受过虚假新闻和恶意言论的影响，如今新兴国家中也不乏受害者，印度选民分化严重，缅甸罗兴亚族（一个少数穆斯林族）受到迫害，不少观察员担心政治深受其害。

3 On the positive side, charities and aid workers talk endlessly and earnestly about how smartphones will allow farmers to check crop prices, let villagers sign up for online education and help doctors boost vaccination rates.

> 不过事情也有积极的一面，说到智能手机的用途，慈善机构和援助工作者简直可以滔滔不绝：农民能用它查看农作物价格；村民能直接报名在线教育；医院还能借此推广疫苗。

4 Less well appreciated is that the main attractions of being online are the same for the second half as they were for the first. Socializing and play, not work and self-improvement, are the draw. Porn is popular. Messaging apps help friends stay in touch, and let migrant workers say goodnight to their children back home. People entertain their friends—and strangers—on social media with **goofy** home-made videos on YouTube or TikTok, an app focused on short, humorous clips. Cheap data plans and **thumb drives** bring **pirated** films to millions who may never have been to a cinema. Dating apps are more popular than farming advice; video games are more popular than either. Such **boons** are unlikely to make their way into many undevelopment reports. But they are a boost to the stock of human happiness.

> 少有人注意到的是，无论第一批还是第二批网民，网络的主要魅力对他们来说是一样的。比起利用网络来工作和提升自我，网民们更喜欢社交和娱乐。当然，还有色情。利用通信软件，朋友们可以保持联系，在外务工的人能跟家中孩子道晚安；人们用社交媒体上的自制视频博朋友和陌生人一笑，比如油管或抖音国际版（TikTok，一款专注于搞笑短视频的手机应用）；得益于实惠的数据套餐和便宜的U盘，数百万人得以开始接触电影——虽然电影是盗版的；约会软件可比务农指导有趣多了。电子游戏的欢迎程度，恐怕还要居于前两者之上。这些便宜之处自然不会在一些发展报告中露脸，但它们却大大提升了人类的幸福感。

5 For businesses, the second half of the internet offers a vast pool of customers. It also brings a headache—most of these new users are too poor to spend very much. Tens of billions of dollars in venture-capital money have flowed into internet startups in emerging markets, excluding China. The Silicon Valley giants have built up big user bases—over 1.5bn Facebook users are in developing countries. YouTube, a video site owned by Google, is increasingly dominated by non-Western users. Last year Walmart spent $16bn buying Flipkart, an Indian e-commerce giant. Jumia, an e-commerce firm with 4m customers in Nigeria and 13 other African countries, floated in New York in April.

> 对于企业来说，互联网第二批网民的涌入则意味着庞大的客户群。不过问题也随之而来，新用户里大部分人比较穷，花不了几个钱。数百亿美元的风险资本流入了新兴国家（中国除外）的互联网初创企业。硅谷的巨擘建立了庞大的用户基础，例如脸书就有15亿发展中国家的用户。非西方用户也逐渐成为谷歌旗下油管的主要用户。去年，沃尔玛斥资160亿美元收购了印度电商巨头弗利普卡特（Flipkart）。遍布尼日利亚及其他13个非洲国家、拥有400万客户的电商公司Jumia，也要于今年4月在纽约上市。

6 Despite these firms’ **punchy** valuations, they are still looking for sustainable business models. Reliance Jio, an Indian firm, has sunk $37bn into building a high-speed mobile network and acquiring a big base of mostly poor users. Each Facebook user in Asia generates only $11 of advertising revenue a year, compared with $112 for a North American one. The combined revenue of all the internet firms in emerging markets (excluding China) is perhaps $100bn a year. That is about the same size as Comcast, America’s 31st-biggest listed firm by sales.

> 尽管这些公司的估值可观，它们仍在摸索可行的商业模式。印度电信Reliance Jio投入了370亿美元建设高速移动网络，希望吸引基数庞大的贫困人口成为客户。希望建立起一个主要由贫困人口组成的庞大用户基础。于脸书而言，亚洲用户人均每年只能带来11美元的广告收入，远远低于北美用户的112美元。毕竟新兴国家（中国除外）所有互联网公司的总收入每年才只有大概1000亿美元，与美国排名31的上市公司康卡斯特的销售额相当。

7 Nonetheless, the impact of these firms on business will get bigger in two ways. First, they will grow fast—although whether fast enough to justify their valuations remains to be seen. To maximize their chances, many are offering not just a single service (such as search or video), as Western firms tended to in their early years, but a bundle of services in one app instead, in the hope of making more money per user. This approach was pioneered in China by Alibaba and Tencent. Go-Jek in Indonesia offers ride-hailing, payments, drug prescriptions and massages. Facebook is pushing a digital payments system in India through its chat service, WhatsApp.

> 尽管如此，互联网公司将会对商业产生两个重大的影响。第一，它们会快速增长，不过其增长速度能否匹配估值仍有待观察。为了最大限度抓住机会，很多公司不会模仿西方公司早年模式，只专注单一的服务（如单一搜索、视频），而是在一个应用软件上捆绑多项服务，尽可能从每一个用户身上赚更多的钱。这种思路最先开始于中国的阿里巴巴和腾讯。有鉴于此，印尼的Go-Jek除了提供叫车外，还提供支付、医药处方和按摩等服务。同时，脸书正计划在印度聊天软件瓦次艾普（WhatsApp）中嵌入数字支付系统。

8 The second is that in the emerging world, established firms are likely to be disrupted more quickly than **incumbents** were in the rich world. They have less infrastructure, such as warehouses and retail sites, to act as a barrier to entry. Many people, especially outside the big cities, lack access to their services entirely. Beer, shampoo and other consumer-goods firms could find that as marketing goes digital, new **insurgent** brands gain traction faster. Banks will be forced to adapt quickly to digital payments or die. Viewed this way, there is a huge amount of money at stake—the total market value of incumbent firms in the emerging world, outside China, is $8trn. If you thought the first half of the internet revolution was disruptive, just wait until you see the second act.

> 其二，与发达国家相比，新兴国家的老牌企业更容易受到影响。他们的仓库和零售点等基础构架薄弱，难以构建行业准入壁垒。不少民众，尤其是大城市以外的人，完全无法享受他们的服务。生产啤酒、洗发水和其他日用消费品公司可能会意识到，随着营销数字化，新兴品牌更容易受到青睐。银行如果不迅速适应数字支付这一趋势，他们也将难逃厄运。从这个角度来看，一大批资金危如累卵，毕竟新兴市场（中国除外）现有公司的总市值为8万亿美元。所以，如果你认为第一次互联网革命已经颠覆了一切，那就等着看第二次互联网革命吧。
