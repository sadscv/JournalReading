# D870 The Asian Pop Stars Taking Center Stage
1.IN THE FALL of 1959 — 14 years after the United States dropped atomic bombs on **Hiroshima** and **Nagasaki** and released Japanese Americans from its domestic **internment camp**s; 13 years after the American territory of the Philippines gained independence; six years after the end of the Korean War; and two months after American soldiers were killed by the **Viet Cong** just north of Saigon, among the first U.S. casualties in Vietnam — three young women from Seoul appeared on “The Ed Sullivan Show” on CBS. The show was an institution, a live **cabaret** every Sunday night that reached more than a quarter of all American households with a TV set. The women called themselves the Kim Sisters — evoking the beloved Andrews Sisters from Minnesota, who sold 50 million records in the 1930s and ’40s — but were in fact a cousin, Min Ja (**Anglicized** as Mia), 17, and two sisters, Sook Ja (later Sue), 21, and Ai-Ja, 18.

2.Sue, coached by her mother, started out performing on American military bases during the war. She sang “Candy and Cake” — in English, a language she didn’t speak — for G.I.s in tents thick with the black smoke of oil stoves, earning her first chocolate bars and Coca-Colas, along with whiskey that her mother traded for essentials on the black market. Only 14 at the time, she was too young to be allowed in venues with beer bottles toppling off tables, but the bookers turned a blind eye. Soon, Sue joined forces with her younger sister and cousin and pragmatically began wearing **form-fitting** dresses slit to midthigh. They learned to **tap dance**; they stopped going hungry.

3.When they got a chance to come to the United States in 1959 — just the three of them, since visas for Asians were limited — their mother told them to steer clear of boys and not to return “until you have become a success,” Sarah Gerdes recounts in a 2016 biography of Sue. They arrived in Las Vegas that winter, penniless, unable to read enough English to tell shampoo from Mr. Clean (with disastrous results) and relying on the kindness of their white male **handler**s. They gamely mounted the stage at the Thunderbird Hotel as part of the China Doll **Revue**, one of a number of Orientalist nightclub shows in big American cities stocked with supposedly foreign women (many actually American-born) in **slinky** **cheongsams**, twirling **parasol**s and fans.

4.But the Kim Sisters, although **relegate**d to the same costumes and accessories, somehow stood apart. Was it because they fit what would become the **paradigm** of the Asian in America, displaying a model minority’s work ethic by mastering more than a dozen instruments, including the saxophone, **bagpipe**s and **upright bass**, along with **tortuous choreography** in high heels; or because they both exploited and resisted the **hypersexualization** of Asian women, opening sets wearing traditional Korean hanbok and then shucking them off to reveal **floofy** little polka-dot dresses, all the while assuring interviewers that they didn’t drink or date, making themselves unthreatening to their white female rivals; or because their isolation and seeming innocence suggested helplessness, inspiring the same protective impulse that led white Americans to adopt thousands of Korean children over the next decade; or because they had the **savvy** to cover contemporary hits like Elvis Presley’s “Jailhouse Rock” (first recorded in 1957) and borrow the bobby socks and **perkiness** of ponytailed American teens, displaying both a willingness to **assimilate** and a **tacit** acknowledgment of the imagined superior appeal of Western culture; or because, as one critic wrote approvingly, they proved that, surprise, surprise, Asians could “have swing”?

5.That fall, when they greeted America on “The Ed Sullivan Show,” they might have been the first Koreans — the first Asians — whom Americans could accept as pop stars, and even want to claim as their own. They went on to perform for Sullivan 22 times, received spreads in Newsweek and Life and released an English-language album through **Monument Record**s. They became American citizens in 1968, when more than half a million American troops were deployed in Vietnam. Then their style of music **fell out of favor**, and they disappeared from sight.
My mother is from the Philippines; I was born in Los Angeles. For years I have combed American history for Asian women ascendant, maybe out of desire for an ancestor, however distant, or to discover if such public recognition were possible, or to take comfort that in my **muddled**, uncertain ambitions I was not alone. I had never heard of the Kim Sisters.

6.IN THE WINTER of 2021 — a year into a pandemic whose origins in China spurred verbal and then physical attacks against people of Asian descent in the United States, and a few months before six ethnically Korean and Chinese women spa workers in Georgia would be shot by a white **evangelical** man who allegedly told the police that he wanted to eliminate sources of sexual temptation — everyone, or at least much of the measurable globe, was listening to the Filipino American singer Olivia Rodrigo, who turned 18 in February. Her first single, the fragile yet anthemic **ballad** “Driver’s License,” **debuted** at No. 1 on the Billboard Hot 100 singles chart and clung there for eight weeks while racking up No. 1s from Belgium to New Zealand. By summer, shortly after the release of her first album, she’d surpassed Ariana Grande in a feat of **ubiquity**, landing the most songs (four) on the Billboard Global 200 at once, and she’d been recruited by the White House to urge young people to get vaccinated against Covid-19.

> **debut**: 初次表演；首次亮相

7.While Rodrigo had already proved herself as the lead in a Disney+ musical TV series, her fellow Filipino American Bella Poarch wasn’t known as a singer. She nevertheless dropped her own single in mid-May, the **tinkly**, nursery rhyme-like “Build a Bitch,” whose Barbie-meets-Frankenstein video was reported to have racked up 10 million views on YouTube in its first 24 hours. In the video, Poarch (who has not disclosed her age but appears to be in her early 20s) is explicitly framed as a product: just a head perched on an assembly line, missing everything from the neck down, until plucked by robot hands and locked onto shoulders to make a living doll for men to purchase. This initial **disembodiment** is **slyly** self-referential, as Poarch’s head is arguably what **catapulted** her to fame, **bobbing** and nodding in a TikTok clip from last year that shows a few seconds of her in close-up, lip-syncing a rap with a twisty mouth, a **faux** sunburn across her cheeks and dark wings of **lashes**. Thanks in part to this **mesmerically innocuous **performance, as of July, Poarch had the fourth largest following on TikTok, around 76 million fans, enough to make up the 20th most populous country on earth.

8.By these metrics, Poarch and Rodrigo are among the most watched and listened to Asian women in the Western world. Certainly they are the first Asian American pop stars to ever command such audiences. Yet their **ancestry** has gone **unremarked** upon by the media, beyond cursory biographical references. Instead, Poarch in particular has been **whitewash**ed by critics who dismiss her success as a matter of “conventional attractiveness” and her being “extremely pretty in a very social media-specific way,” arguing that her popularity is the result of an algorithm that rewards the utterly **generic**. But in a Western context, there’s nothing conventional about Poarch’s appearance. She doesn’t physically resemble the white girls next door who rank above her in the TikTok hierarchy, nor does she share their experience: She is an immigrant who came to the U.S. as an adolescent and has spoken in interviews about how she was bullied for the way she looks. Asian faces vary greatly, but there are certain features that I always seek out when I scan a crowd, as if hoping to find myself, and I see them in Poarch: the petal-shaped, **shallow-set** eyes so brown they’re almost black; the flat brow; the faint duskiness that, as the historian Michael Keevak has noted, the 18th-century Swedish **taxonomist** Carl Linnaeus classified first as “**fuscus**,” “dark,” and later “**luridus**” — “**ghastly**; yellow.”

9.Hers is the kind of face that was historically excluded from Western **pantheons** of beauty, with the few exceptions explicitly framed as exotic and essentially unknowable. The first Chinese woman on record as an official visitor to the United States, Afong Moy, arrived in New York in 1834 at age 19 as part of an exhibition of Chinese goods arranged by American merchants, in which she sat silently on a throne and displayed her bound feet for **gawkers** who paid 50 cents each. One commentator labeled her “a perfect little **vixen**.” Nearly a century later, in 1932, the Hollywood fan magazine Picture Play ascribed a “fatalistic acquiescence” to Anna May Wong, the first and for many years only Asian American female movie star, routinely confined to dragon-lady or slave-girl roles: “Animation scarcely ever **ruffles** the **tranquillity** of her round face.” To Western audiences of the time, the unfamiliarity of Asian features made them almost illegible, part of a psychological phenomenon called “own-race bias,” in which members of one race have trouble distinguishing among members of another, leading to the false notion that all Asians look — and are — alike. (As the Korean American singer Audrey Nuna raps on her new album, “Never seen a face like mine in the **cockpit**.”)

10.If others couldn’t read us, it had to be our fault for denying them access to our inner selves, and so we’ve been cast as **inscrutable**, **withholding**, even devious. To this day, the image persists in the West of Asians as **ciphers** who are **adept at** calculating and competing but lack the emotional complexity and vulnerability of our white counterparts; who are, in other words, not fully human. I remember in 2004 watching the reality TV show “America’s Next Top Model” and feeling my insides knot as one of its first Asian contestants, April Wilkner, got axed after judges described her as “mechanical” and said, “She thinks too much.” A lawsuit filed in 2014 against Harvard University — which was decided in Harvard’s favor and is now awaiting consideration for review by the Supreme Court — alleged discrimination in the admissions process and presented evidence that Asian applicants were consistently given lower ratings on character traits such as “**likability**,” “kindness” and “integrity.” When we achieve, it’s often discounted as **rote** proficiency instead of **innate** talent — **rigor** and **mimicry**, at the expense of heart and soul.

> **inscrutable**: 不可思议的
>
> **withholding**: 抑制
>
> **cipher**: a person or thing of no importance, especially a person who does the bidding of others and seems to have no will of their own.
