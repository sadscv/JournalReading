1 BETWEEN 1965 and 1968 Nancy Sinatra was a pivotal figure in popular music. Now 80 years old, Ms Sinatra may not have been long in the spotlight, but her music is unforgettable and her influence enduring. Four decades after Ms Sinatra’s heyday, Lana Del Rey launched herself as “the gangsta Nancy Sinatra” in the certainty everyone would understand exactly what she meant.

> **Gangsta** or **gangsta rap** is a form of rap music in which the words often refer to crime and violence. （冈斯特说唱乐(歌词常涉及犯罪和暴力)）

> Nancy Sinatra 在1965至1968年间是流行音乐的关键人物。如今80岁的她虽然不在聚光灯之下，但是她的音乐仍令人难忘，她的影响源远流长。在她的巅峰期40年之后，她的名字仍被人提起，Lana Del Rey将自己称作是“the gangsta Nancy Sinatra（黑化Nancy Sinatra）",这个称号大家都能知道所指何意。

2 Ms Sinatra **bore the name** of one of the 20th century’s musical titans, yet she established an identity and a legacy in no way **beholden to** her father. Even **being signed to** Frank Sinatra’s **record label**, Reprise, and recording a global chart-topping **duet** with him (“Somethin’ Stupid” in 1967), didn’t confine her to his shadow. This **number** doesn’t feature on “Start Walkin’ 1965-1976”, a new, remastered collection; there are too many tracks of greater substance to fit in.

> **bear the name:** to be named after someone  以....为名
>
> **beholden to** : If you are **beholden to** someone, you are in debt to them in some way or you feel that you have a duty to them because they have helped you. 欠...人情的
>
> **record label:** a company that produces and sells records, CDs, and recordings 唱片公司
>
> **signed**: engage (someone, typically a sports player or a musician) to work for one by signing a contract with them. 被（唱片公司）签约
>
> **number**: You can refer to a short piece of music, a song, or a dance as a **number**. 一首 (歌曲、乐曲); 一段 (舞蹈)
>
> **duet:** 二重奏

> 虽然nancy的爸爸是20世纪的著名音乐人，她打小活在父亲的光环之下，曾经的金曲也是来自于父亲唱片公司，但nancy没有将自己限制住，她也闯出了自己的事业。

3 She was not a singer of notable technical **prowess** or vocal range. When Ms Sinatra recorded “You Only Live Twice” (1967), one of the most memorable James Bond themes, John Barry, the producer, assembled the final vocal from pieces of over two dozen **takes**. Yet her voice and image **exuded** personality. Her **prime** coincided with perhaps the most accelerated period of invention in pop, with abundant dazzling talents—The Beatles, Bob Dylan, Brian Wilson, much of the Tamla Motown operation—at their creative peaks. She **held her own** among them.

> Someone's **prowess** is their great skill at doing something. 杰出的技能
>
> A **take** is a short piece of action which is filmed in one continuous process for a movie. (电影中一次连续拍摄的) 镜头
>
> If someone **exudes** a quality or feeling, or if it **exudes**, they show that they have it to a great extent. 充分显露; 洋溢
>
> If someone or something is **in** their **prime**, they are at the stage in their existence when they are at their strongest, most active, or most successful. 鼎盛时期
>
> **hold one's own**: retain a position of strength in a challenging situation.挺住

> 作为一名歌手，她并没有高超的技巧或音域。她那首最为知名的007主题曲“You Only Live Twice"，是从20多次录音中合成出来的。但是她的声音和形象独具个人魅力，她的鼎盛时期正好与流行音乐的上升期重合。在那期间，如Betales、Bob Dylan等一众天才正处于创作巅峰，但是她的光芒在其中毫不逊色。

4 She did this as one of the most **subversive** figures in music. While the counterculture **sneered** or raged at the straight world, **Ms Sinatra infiltrated the mainstream with bright, kitschy, seditious ditties—pop contraband brimful of smuggled filth and covert drug references** (she topped Billboard’s Easy Listening chart in 1967 with “Sugar Town”, a **veiled paen** to LSD). Her co-conspirator in this enterprise was the late Lee Hazlewood, initially her writer and producer, thereafter her singing partner, too. Hazlewood, a **formidable** cult artist in his own right, has often been perceived as a **Svengali** figure: an older, industry-**savvy** veteran controlling an **ingénue**. But this misrepresents both their relationship and their working dynamic—they were, both always insisted, respectful (and **platonic**) peers.

Something that is **subversive** is intended to weaken or destroy a political system or government. 颠覆性的

**Svengali** : a person who controls another's mind, usually with sinister intentions 斯文加利; 控制别人思想的人



5 Their collaboration produced her breakthrough hit, “These Boots Are Made For Walkin’”, as Ms Sinatra had told Hazlewood that the song demanded a female vocalist. “It sounds hateful when a man sings it,” she insisted, and she was right. Her own reading was tough, proto-feminist, a promise of retribution in kind to men who treated women like doormats. “Boots” established the style that defined her: indomitable self-assertion blended with coquettish sensuality. She could threaten, coax and titillate, sometimes all at once: the archetype of the Bad Girl who refuses to be wholesome or victimised or submissive, those being the principal roles for women pop singers before her.

6 Backed by the celebrated “Wrecking Crew” of session musicians, Ms Sinatra and Hazlewood turned out a series of hits, arranged by Billy Strange, whose eerie tremolo guitar became a distinctive feature of her work. It shivered through her cover of Cher’s song “Bang Bang (My Baby Shot Me Down)” (1966), later deployed to riveting effect by Quentin Tarantino in “Kill Bill: Vol. 1”. Ms Sinatra was something of an inadvertent nemesis to Cher; she and Elvis Presley starred in the successful film “Speedway” (1968), originally earmarked as a Sonny And Cher vehicle. And as the latter duo’s tandem career foundered, Ms Sinatra and Hazlewood deployed a similar yet hipper shtick on the album “Nancy And Lee” (1968), a commercial and artistic triumph that includes, in “Some Velvet Morning”, as strange and brilliant a male/female duet as has ever been recorded.

7 Everything changed when, in the early 1970s, Hazlewood abruptly emigrated to Sweden, giving Ms Sinatra neither warning nor explanation. (His principal motivation, it later emerged, was to protect his son from being drafted to fight in Vietnam.) Although they would make two more LPs together as a duo, her career did not recover. But in truth, it was already on the way down. Her chart placings had dropped, and her moment of cultural significance had passed. She would continue to make intriguing records, and “Start Walkin’” uncovers some of these curios: “How Are Things In California?” (1970), a luscious pastiche of The Mamas and the Papas that arrived two years too late; the “Arkansas Coal” suite (1972), an ornate and dramatic rendering of a mining tragedy; “Hook And Ladder” (1971), which was well timed for the country-pop boom but missed out all the same.

8 Her next flash of fame would have to wait until 1995, with a photoshoot and cover for Playboy. “I needed the money,” she explained. “I wanted to do a recording comeback and I didn’t have the funds for it. I was a single mom.” What might, at 24, have seemed a sordid concession was, at 54, an act of boldness that many women applauded. An eye-catching promotional photo in the new compilation’s booklet shows Ms Sinatra wearing a trench coat and brandishing a selection of weaponry. The original “gangsta Nancy Sinatra”, let’s remember, was Nancy Sinatra.
