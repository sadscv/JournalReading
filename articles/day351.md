## Her peak was brief; her impact lasting

1 BETWEEN 1965 and 1968 Nancy Sinatra was a pivotal figure in popular music. Now 80 years old, Ms Sinatra may not have been long in the spotlight, but her music is unforgettable and her influence enduring. Four decades after Ms Sinatra’s heyday, Lana Del Rey launched herself as “the gangsta Nancy Sinatra” in the certainty everyone would understand exactly what she meant.

> **Gangsta** or **gangsta rap** is a form of rap music in which the words often refer to crime and violence. （冈斯特说唱乐\(歌词常涉及犯罪和暴力\)）
>
> Nancy Sinatra 在1965至1968年间是流行音乐的关键人物。如今80岁的她虽然不在聚光灯之下，但是她的音乐仍令人难忘，她的影响源远流长。在她的巅峰期40年之后，她的名字仍被人提起，Lana Del Rey将自己称作是“the gangsta Nancy Sinatra（冈斯特版Nancy Sinatra）",这个称号大家都能知道所指何意。

2 Ms Sinatra **bore the name** of one of the 20th century’s musical titans, yet she established an identity and a legacy in no way **beholden to** her father. Even **being signed to** Frank Sinatra’s **record label**, Reprise, and recording a global chart-topping **duet** with him \(“Somethin’ Stupid” in 1967\), didn’t confine her to his shadow. This **number** doesn’t feature on “Start Walkin’ 1965-1976”, a new, remastered collection; there are too many tracks of greater substance to fit in.

> **bear the name:** to be named after someone 以....为名
>
> **beholden to** : If you are **beholden to** someone, you are in debt to them in some way or you feel that you have a duty to them because they have helped you. 欠...人情的
>
> **record label:** a company that produces and sells records, CDs, and recordings 唱片公司
>
> **signed**: engage \(someone, typically a sports player or a musician\) to work for one by signing a contract with them. 被（唱片公司）签约
>
> **number**: You can refer to a short piece of music, a song, or a dance as a **number**. 一首 \(歌曲、乐曲\); 一段 \(舞蹈\)
>
> **duet:** 二重奏
>
> 虽然nancy的爸爸是20世纪的著名音乐人，她打小活在父亲的光环之下，曾经的金曲也是来自于父亲唱片公司，但nancy没有将自己限制住，她也闯出了自己的事业。

3 She was not a singer of notable technical **prowess** or vocal range. When Ms Sinatra recorded “You Only Live Twice” \(1967\), one of the most memorable James Bond themes, John Barry, the producer, assembled the final vocal from pieces of over two dozen **takes**. Yet her voice and image **exuded** personality. Her **prime** coincided with perhaps the most accelerated period of invention in pop, with abundant dazzling talents—The Beatles, Bob Dylan, Brian Wilson, much of the Tamla Motown operation—at their creative peaks. She **held her own** among them.

> Someone's **prowess** is their great skill at doing something. 杰出的技能
>
> A **take** is a short piece of action which is filmed in one continuous process for a movie. \(电影中一次连续拍摄的\) 镜头
>
> If someone **exudes** a quality or feeling, or if it **exudes**, they show that they have it to a great extent. 充分显露; 洋溢
>
> If someone or something is **in** their **prime**, they are at the stage in their existence when they are at their strongest, most active, or most successful. 鼎盛时期
>
> **hold one's own**: retain a position of strength in a challenging situation.挺住
>
> 作为一名歌手，她并没有高超的技巧或音域。她那首最为知名的007主题曲“You Only Live Twice"，是从20多次录音中合成出来的。但是她的声音和形象独具个人魅力，她的鼎盛时期正好与流行音乐的上升期重合。在那期间，如Betales、Bob Dylan等一众天才正处于创作巅峰，但是她的光芒在其中毫不逊色。

4 She did this as one of the most **subversive** figures in music. While the counterculture **sneered** or raged at the straight world, **Ms Sinatra infiltrated the mainstream with bright, kitschy, seditious ditties—pop contraband brimful of smuggled filth and covert drug references** \(she topped Billboard’s Easy Listening chart in 1967 with “Sugar Town”, a **veiled paen** to LSD\). Her co-conspirator in this enterprise was the late Lee Hazlewood, initially her writer and producer, thereafter her singing partner, too. Hazlewood, a **formidable** cult artist **in his own right**, has often been perceived as a **Svengali** figure: an older, industry-**savvy** veteran controlling an **ingénue**. But this misrepresents both their relationship and their working dynamic—they were, both always insisted, respectful \(and **platonic**\) peers.

> Something that is **subversive** is intended to weaken or destroy a political system or government. 颠覆性的
>
> If you **sneer** **at** someone or something, you express your contempt for them by the expression on your face or by what you say. 嘲笑
>
> **kitschy**：（艺术上）肤浅的、矫揉造作的、低级庸俗的
>
> A **seditious** act, speech, or piece of writing encourages people to fight against or oppose the government. \(言行或写作\)煽动性的
>
> A **ditty** is a short or light-hearted song or poem. 小曲; 歌谣
>
> **Contraband** refers to goods that are taken into or out of a country illegally. 走私品
>
> Someone who is **brimful** **of** an emotion or quality feels or seems full of it. 充满的
>
> A **veiled** comment is expressed in a disguised form rather than directly and openly. 含蓄的
>
> **Svengali** : a person who controls another's mind, usually with sinister intentions 斯文加利; 控制别人思想的人
>
> If you describe someone as having **savvy**, you think that they have a good understanding and practical knowledge of something. 洞察力; 见解
>
> **Platonic** relationships or feelings of affection do not involve sex. 柏拉图式的
>
> Sinatra是音乐史中最具颠覆性的形象之一。当反主流文化面对主流文化的态度还是嘲笑或愤怒时，她却靠唱轻佻低俗的小黄歌打入了主流市场，讲一些流行违禁品（走私、drug之流）。比如在1967年登顶流行音乐榜的”Sugar Town“，其实就是LSD的含蓄代称。
>
> 和她搞事情的搭档是Lee Hazlewood，最初是她的作词人和制作人，接着成为她的合唱。Hazlewood这个靠自己实力成名的邪典艺术家，通常却被视作一个斯文加利形象 : 一名对行业有深刻洞察力的老男人，控制着一个天真无邪的少女。不过这可就误会了两人的关系及动机，他们维持的一直是平等、互重的柏拉图式的关系。

5 Their collaboration produced her breakthrough hit, “These Boots Are Made For Walkin’”, as Ms Sinatra had told Hazlewood that the song demanded a female vocalist. “It sounds hateful when a man sings it,” she insisted, and she was right. **Her own reading** was tough, proto-feminist, a promise of **retribution** in kind to men who treated women like **doormats**. “Boots” established the style that defined her: **indomitable** self-assertion blended with **coquettish** sensuality. She could threaten, coax and titillate, sometimes all at once: the archetype of the Bad Girl who refuses to be wholesome or victimised or submissive, those being the principal roles for women pop singers before her.



> 他俩的合作使她获得了突破性的成功。正如Sinatra曾对Hazlewood所说的那样，“These Boots Are Made For Walkin“这首歌需要一位女歌手，她坚称：男人唱这首歌时，听起来很讨厌。她是对的。
>
> 她对自我形象的定义是一个严厉的原始女权主义者，发誓要对那些把女人弃如蔽履的男人进行报复。“Boot”这首歌确立了能够定义她的风格:坚韧自信与妖艳性感的结合体。她会威胁，会哄骗，会挑逗他人，有时候这三者还能同时进行。白莲花或是温顺受害者是在她之前的流行女歌手的主要形象，而作为《Bad Girl》的原型，她是拒绝成为这样的人。

> **Retribution** is punishment for a crime, especially punishment that is carried out by someone other than the official authorities. 惩罚; 报应
>
> If you say that someone is a **doormat**, you are criticizing them because they let other people treat them badly, and do not complain or defend themselves when they are being treated unfairly. 受气包
>
> If you say that someone has an **indomitable** spirit, you admire them because they never give up or admit that they have been defeated. 不屈不挠的; 不服输的
>
> If you describe a woman as **coquettish**, you mean she acts in a playful way that is intended to make men find her attractive. 卖弄风情的
>
> If you **coax** someone **into** doing something, you gently try to persuade them to do it. 哄
>
> If something **titillates** someone, it pleases and excites them, especially in a sexual way. 挑逗

6 Backed by the celebrated “Wrecking Crew” of **session musicians**, Ms Sinatra and Hazlewood turned out a series of hits, arranged by Billy Strange, whose eerie tremolo guitar became a distinctive feature of her work. It **shivered through** her cover of Cher’s song “Bang Bang \(My Baby Shot Me Down\)” \(1966\), later deployed to **riveting** effect by Quentin Tarantino in “Kill Bill: Vol. 1”. Ms Sinatra was something of an **inadvertent nemesis** to Cher; she and Elvis Presley starred in the successful film “Speedway” \(1968\), originally **earmarked** as a Sonny And Cher vehicle. And as the latter duo’s **tandem** career **foundered**, Ms Sinatra and Hazlewood deployed a similar yet hipper **shtick** on the album “Nancy And Lee” \(1968\), a commercial and artistic triumph that includes, in “Some Velvet Morning”, as strange and brilliant a male/female duet as has ever been recorded.

> **session musicians** — professional musicians who perform in individual sessions rather than being a permanent member of an ensemble. 会话音乐家\(一个自由歌手或乐器演奏家。会话音乐家可以与临时需要额外播放器的团体一起演奏，也可以受雇为某个活动演奏或为广告录制音乐。\)
>
> If something such as a plan or project **founders**, it fails because of a particular point, difficulty, or problem. 失败
>
> An entertainer's **schtick** is a series of funny or entertaining things that they say or do. 滑稽动作
>
> **vehicle**: a film, television programme, song,
>
> **shtick:** a gimmick, comic routine, style of performance, etc. associated with a particular person.

> Sinatrat 和Hazlewood在知名会话音乐家的支持之下，推出了一系列成功歌曲。其中包含翻唱Cher的歌曲Bang Bang,这首歌在后来成为了昆庭的“杀死比尔”的引人入胜的配乐。在某种意义上，Sinatra成为了Cher的无意中的敌人，她和Elvis主演了“Speedway”这部成功电影，而这部电影之前宣传的主角是Sonny和Cher。Sonny和Cher这一对职业失败时，Sinatra和Hazlewood发布了一部相似但更hipper的专辑“Nancy and lee”，其中包含了“Some Velvet Morning”：一首即奇怪又卓越的二重唱。

7 Everything changed when, in the early 1970s, Hazlewood abruptly emigrated to Sweden, giving Ms Sinatra neither warning nor explanation. \(His principal motivation, it later emerged, was to protect his son from being drafted to fight in Vietnam.\) Although they would make two more LPs together as a duo, her career did not recover. But in truth, it was already on the way down. Her chart placings had dropped, and her moment of cultural significance had passed. She would continue to make intriguing records, and “Start Walkin’” uncovers some of these curios: “How Are Things In California?” \(1970\), a luscious pastiche of The Mamas and the Papas that arrived two years too late; the “Arkansas Coal” suite \(1972\), an ornate and dramatic rendering of a mining tragedy; “Hook And Ladder” \(1971\), which was well timed for the country-pop boom but missed out all the same.

20世纪70年代初， H移民瑞典后这一切发生了变化。之后虽然两人也有合作，但Nancy的事业一直在走下坡路。

8 Her next flash of fame would have to wait until 1995, with a photoshoot and cover for Playboy. “I needed the money,” she explained. “I wanted to do a recording comeback and I didn’t have the funds for it. I was a single mom.” What might, at 24, have seemed a sordid concession was, at 54, an act of boldness that many women applauded. An eye-catching promotional photo in the new compilation’s booklet shows Ms Sinatra wearing a trench coat and brandishing a selection of weaponry. The original “gangsta Nancy Sinatra”, let’s remember, was Nancy Sinatra.
