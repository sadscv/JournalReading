1 If business had a Moses, “Thou shalt link pay to performance” would be on his tablet. Compensation committees have, however, tended to stick to a narrow reading of the **commandment**. Whereas they reward good behaviour, deterring the bad is an afterthought. Worried that this may lead bosses to adopt a mentality of “**heads we win, tails shareholders lose**”, boards are rethinking their priorities—partly in response to pressure from regulators and investors, but also to shifting social winds. Perfectly balanced incentives remain as elusive as the promised land. Still, measures designed to ensure that misconduct does not pay are becoming central to the debate about how to craft bosses’ salary plans.

> 若商界也有一位摩西，那他的碑文上应有这句话：“ 汝当将功而绩”。不过，薪酬委员会对此可能倾向于更狭义地理解。虽然他们对良好表现进行了奖励，防止不当行为却是事后才被想起。鉴于这样做可能会导致企业管理者们采取"正面我们赢，反面股东输"的心态，董事会们正重新思考企业管理者们的优先性——部分原因是回应来自监管机构和投资者的压力，但同样也出于社会风气的转变。完美平衡的激励措施如那应许之地般难寻。尽管如此，旨在确保那些不端行为不会被奖励的措施，正在成为如何制定企业管理者的薪酬计划的讨论中心。

2 The most striking change of recent years has been the rise of the “**clawback**”. This is a provision in pay plans that gives the board the right (or, less commonly, an obligation) to **yank** bonuses or stock awards given but later found to be unjustly earned. A prototype, contained in America’s Sarbanes-Oxley reforms of 2002, required retrieving pay from chief executives and chief financial officers whose sins caused accounting **restatements**. The idea **gained** **traction** after the global financial crisis. The European Union mandated **recouping** money from **wayward** bankers. In America Congress told regulators to craft a new clawback rule. While they **mulled** this, big firms got the message and began to draw up such policies voluntarily. Some 93% of those in the s&p 500 index now say they have one covering cash bonuses, equity awards or both, according to ISS, a proxy-advisory firm, up from a small minority before Sarbanes-Oxley.

> 近些年来，最显著的改变是“资金追回”措施的兴起。这是一项在薪酬计划中的限制条款，使得董事会有权力（或更少见的是，有义务）去收回那些已给出的，但在后来被发现是不法获得的奖金或股权奖励。这项条款的原型诞生于2002年美国萨班斯-奥克斯利法案，这项改革要求， 若CEO或CFO因不法行为而导致公司发布会计更正报告，公司有权追回他们的报酬。这个想法在全球金融危机之后变得越来越受欢迎。欧盟被授予权利以收回不遵守原则的银行家的钱。在美国，国会要求监管机构起草一项新的追回资金规定。当政府还在酝酿这些时，大企业得到讯号，也开始自发地起草相关政策。据代理投票机构ISS所述，在萨班斯法案推出之前，仅有很少一部分标普500公司有着或是涉及现金奖励，或是涉及股权激励的，或是二者兼具的相关追回政策，而如今这比例升至约93%。

3 As such provisions have grown in popularity, two things have happened. First, the list of **misdeeds** covered has lengthened. What initially applied solely to criminal financial conduct now extends to almost anything that might damage a firm’s reputation. That includes creating a toxic corporate culture, sexual harassment and “inappropriate” personal relationships; **cupping backsides** is taken as seriously as **cooking books**.

> **Cupping someone's backside** means holding one or both of someone's buttocks in the curved hand or hands. It is one example of casual sexual touching, that is assault if unwanted, that can happen in the workplace or elsewhere.

> 随着此类限制条款变得流行，两件事应运而生。第一，不端行为的列表加长。最开始它仅仅适用于刑事金融行为，而如今几乎延伸到任何可能破坏公司声誉的事情。这包括产生有害的公司文化，性骚扰以及“不恰当”的个人关系；“摸臀”行为（性骚扰）与做假帐一样，备受关注。

4 The second development is that more firms—albeit still a minority—are **plucking up** the courage to invoke the provisions. Wells Fargo clawed back $28m from John Stumpf on top of the $41m he **forfeited** when he resigned as ceo of the lender in 2016, after a probe concluded he had **engendered** a culture that encouraged employees to open fake accounts to lift sales. Goldman Sachs tapped a dozen current and former executives for $175m last year to help ease the pain of whopping fines over the investment bank’s role in the 1mdb **embezzlement** scandal. McDonald’s is trying to recoup $57m of **severance** pay from its ex-boss, Steve Easterbrook, who was fired over sexual relationships with underlings.

> 第二，尽管还是少数，但越来越多的公司正鼓起勇气来援引这些限制条款。2016年，约翰·斯坦夫辞去富国银行的CEO职位。在调查发现他催生了一种鼓励员工开假帐户从而增加销售量的文化之后，富国银行在斯坦夫放弃4100万美元的基础上，又向他追回了2800万美元。去年，为了缓解由于1MDB丑闻事件对投行的巨额罚款压力，高盛集团向它的多名现任以及前任高管追回1.75亿美元。史蒂夫·伊斯特布鲁克曾是麦当劳的CEO，由于与下属的性关系而被开除，麦当劳也正尝试向这位前老板追回5700万美元的离职金。

5 The Goldman Sachs case encapsulates the pros and cons of clawbacks. The firm won **plaudits** for its stance; here was a Wall Street giant willing to make **top brass** pick up some of the tab for wrongdoing. But what initially seemed a bold move became an embarrassment when Gary Cohn, its former second-in-command, who had **cashed in** his pay awards on joining the Trump administration in 2016, **demurred**. The stand-off ended when Mr Cohn agreed to pay a sum, reportedly $10m, to charity. Much as the bank tried to **spin** this as fair, it was made to look impotent.

> 高盛事件体现了追回款的利与弊。高盛由于它的立场而备受赞扬；这位华尔街巨头愿意让高层就他们为不端行为部分买单。但是，这项最初看起来大胆的举措，由于高盛前二把手加里·科恩的抗议而陷入尴尬境地。因为加里·科恩在2016年加入特朗普团队时已经兑现了他的薪酬。这一僵局一直持续到科恩先生同意为慈善机构捐款据说一千万美元才结束。尽管高盛努力把这件事粉饰得公平，但是它看上去仍然很无力。

6 The episode underlines that, when it comes to compensation, he who has already **paid the piper** finds it harder to **call the tune**. Goldman Sachs’s board could have **shown more spine** and seen Mr Cohn in court, if only to signal it was serious about **holding grandees to account**. That, though, would have been costly and risky. Lawyers’ fees might have exceeded what Mr Cohn owed as they **wrangled** over what is “excessive” pay, “inappropriate” behaviour or “inadequate” oversight in a scandal that involved decisions at many levels.

> If you say 'He who **pays the piper**' or 'He who **pays the piper calls the tune**', you mean that the person who provides the money for something decides what will be done, or has a right to decide what will be done.　谁出钱，谁说了算。

> When you tell **some** one to **show some spine** or **show some backbone**, you are telling them to be brave or morally strong. If someone has no **backbone** or is spineless, it means they are a coward 表现得更勇敢、强硬

> 这件事强调了：在薪酬问题上，付了钱的人更难作主。高盛集团董事会本可以态度更强硬，甚至与科恩对峙法庭，只要它表示对于让高层买单行为这件事的认真性。虽然，这样可能成本巨大，风险众多。当双方就这场涉及多个层面决定的丑闻中的“过度”支付，“不当”行为或者“不足”监管而争论时，律师费用可能已经超过了科恩先生对公司的欠款。
>

7 The court might have sided with Mr Cohn, who was never personally accused of wrongdoing. Boards must also consider potential bad publicity. McDonald’s was put **on the back foot** when Mr Easterbrook claimed it already had information about his **liaisons**, including sexually explicit emails, when it approved his **severance package**.

> **on the back foot **: 处于不利境地
>
> 法庭可能会支持科恩先生，因为他本人从未因不法行为受过控告。董事会也必须要考虑潜在的负面公众形象。伊斯特布鲁克先生声称，麦当劳在批准他离职金的时候就已经知道了他的裸露的性邮件等性丑闻，而这也让麦当劳（在这场官司中）处于劣势。

8 Unsurprisingly, then, some firms try to just put the mess behind them. GE decided last month not to claw back pay from an ex-boss, Jeff Immelt, after a huge write-off and a probe into disclosure policies led to a $200m fine for the industrial conglomerate. (He denies wrongdoing.) Drugmakers accused of stoking the **opioid** epidemic have also eschewed clawbacks. Such clauses may deter some executives from reporting misconduct. And broadening what is considered wrongdoing creates ambiguity. Some firms include behaviour “embarrassing” to them. Might a ceo expressing **exotic** political views count?

> N-COUNT可数名词A **write-off** is something, such as a living expense, that can be deducted from your taxes. 从税中扣除的费用
>
> Something that is **exotic** is unusual and interesting, usually because it comes from or is related to a distant country. (常因来自遥远的他国而显得) 奇异的
>
> 不足为奇的是，一些公司想要把这些烂摊子抛诸脑后。上个月，通用电气决定不向前老板杰夫伊梅尔特追回款项。此前，这个工业集团由于大额偷税以及公开政策的调查而被罚款2亿美元（杰夫伊梅尔特否认了不法行为）。被控加剧鸦片类药物泛滥的制药商同样也拒绝了追回款项。这些条款可能会阻止高管报告不法行为。并且，扩大不法行为的范畴会导致界限不明。有些公司将“让其难堪的行为”包含在内。那或许CEO表达不同寻常的政治观点也应该包含在内？

> **9 Fire, brimstone and bonuses**

> **Fire and brimstone** is an idiomatic expression referring to God's wrath found in both the Hebrew Bible and the Christian New Testament. In the Bible, it often appears in reference to the fate of the unfaithful.

> Still, deterrence efforts are proliferating. One popular policy is to lengthen deferral periods for pay, by a year or more for cash bonuses, and a similar period beyond the **vesting date** for equity grants—in some cases until after the executive leaves the firm. Though less dramatic than clawbacks, this has the advantage of reducing the chance that the money has left the company before alleged misbehaviour emerges. Last month cvs Health, other pharmacy chains and even a few drugmakers (like Bristol Myers Squibb), agreed on a set of extended-deferral principles with a group of investors who had threatened to **agitate** over the firms’ role in the opioid crisis.

> If people **agitate** **for** something, they protest or take part in political activity in order to get it. 抗争，抨击
>
> 惩罚和奖励
>
> 尽管如此，威慑手段正在激增。其中一个流行的政策是增加报酬的延期发放时间。对于现金奖励将延期一年以上再发放，对于股权激励则是再推迟一年以上的行权日期（在某些情况下将延期至这个高管离开公司后）。虽然不及追回资金那么引人注目，但是它能降低在不端行为浮现之前钱已经离开公司的风险。上个月，西维斯健康，其他连锁药店，甚至一些药物生产公司（例如百时美施贵宝公司）就一套延期支付原则与一群投资人达成了共识，这群投资人曾经威胁要抨击这些公司在鸦片类危机中扮演的角色。

10 Clawbacks, too, will spread. For one thing, the pandemic recession has **stoked** anger over excessive executive pay—particularly perceived pay-for-failure such as Boeing’s $62m payoff to Dennis Muilenburg, who **presided over** the **bungled** response to two crashes of its 737 max passenger jets. And big investors like such provisions. In just a few years BlackRock, the world’s biggest asset manager, has gone from **tepid** to wholehearted support for them. What better way to focus executives’ minds than to make it clear that what the board giveth, the board can take away?

> **stoke**: encourage or incite (a strong emotion or tendency)

>
> If you **bungle** something, you fail to do it properly, because you make mistakes or are clumsy. 搞砸
>
> Water or another liquid that is **tepid** is slightly warm. 微温的
>
> 追回款政策同样也会蔓延开来。一方面，疫情下的经济衰退激化了对过度支付高层薪酬的怒火——尤其是对失败的买单。例如波音公司向丹尼斯-穆伦伯格支付了6200万美元的报酬，而两次737 max客机坠毁事故的拙劣应对都是由他负责的。而大投资者喜欢这样的规定。在短短几年内，世界上最大的资产管理公司黑石集团（BlackRock）对它们从不温不火到现在全心全意的支持。难道还有什么方法比明确董事会给予的东西，它也可以收回更能集中高管思想吗？
