### The city is a backdrop to two tales of self-discovery

Fake Accounts. By Lauren Oyler. Catapult; 272 pages; $26. Fourth Estate; £12.99

In the End, It Was All About Love. By Musa Okwonga. Rough Trade Books; 132 pages; £11.99

1 Berlin ought to collapse under the weight of its past. Its 20th century was scarred by revolution, **tyranny**, genocide and partition, each remembered in the **solemn** monuments and museums that dot the city today. But there has long been a second Berlin, this one a **blank slate** and haven for young Europeans, Americans, **Antipodeans** and other free spirits seeking cheap rent, like-minded souls and perhaps a second adolescence. This is a metropolis of **edgy** galleries, smoky bars, empty streets and casual **liaisons**; of **perfunctory** efforts to learn German, 30-somethings serving out internships, and soul-sapping battles with the **paper-pushers** of the Ausländerbehörde (immigration offices).

> A **tyranny** is a cruel, harsh, and unfair government in which a person or small group of people have power over everyone else. 专制暴政
>
> Someone or something that is **solemn** is very serious rather than cheerful or humorous. (人) 严肃的; (物) 庄严的
>
> **blank slate** :someone or something that is still in an original state and that has not yet been changed by people, experiences, etc.
>
> **Antipodeans** : a person from Australia or New Zealand (used by inhabitants of the northern hemisphere).
>
>  **edgy:** at the forefront of a trend; experimental or avant-garde.. 前卫的
>
> **Liaison**:  noun (RELATIONSHIP) a sexual relationship, especially between two people not married to each other. e.g. He's had a number of **liaisons**.
>
>  **perfunctory** action is done quickly and carelessly, and shows a lack of interest in what you are doing. 敷衍的; 潦草的
>
> **paper-pushers**:小文员

> 柏林应在他沉重的过去中坍塌。它的20世纪因革命、暴政、种族屠杀及分裂而伤痕累累，而每一道伤痕，都在今天被城市中星罗棋布的庄严纪念碑和博物馆所铭刻。但是，长久以来都有另一个柏林：一个对于欧洲、美洲、大洋洲的年轻人和其它自由不羁之人的处女地和港湾，他们在此寻找租金低廉的居所，志趣相投的灵魂，或许还有第二春。这是一个充斥着前卫画廊、烟雾缭绕的酒吧、空荡荡的街道和随意性关系的城市；这也是一个敷衍地学习德语、30来岁开始实习生涯、心力焦悴地与移民局职员斗争的城市。

2 This version of Berlin offers almost unlimited creative, recreational and sexual possibilities—albeit usually within a handful of **gentrify**ing neighbourhoods in the city’s east—and is the backdrop for two new books by young Anglophone writers. Neither “Fake Accounts”, a debut novel by Lauren Oyler, an American critic who once lived in Berlin, nor “In the End, It Was All About Love” by Musa Okwonga, a British writer and musician who still does, is really about the German capital. Its **tumultuous** history barely features in either; nor, with the odd exception, do its contemporary politics. Instead, Berlin offers the **protagonists** the space they need to examine and discover themselves.

 

> When a street or area **is gentrified**, it becomes a more expensive place to live because wealthy people move into the area and buy the houses where people with less money used to live. 使(地区)贵族化
>
> A **tumultuous** event or period of time involves many exciting and confusing events or feelings. 激动的; 混乱的
>
> N-COUNT[正式]可数名词A **protagonist** in a play, novel, or real event is one of the main people in it. (戏剧、小说或真实事件里的) 主人公 
>

> 这个版本的柏林，有着在创造力、娱乐和性生活上的无限可能性（尽管这种可能性通常仅存在于城市东区的贵族住宅区中）。这个版本的柏林，也是两位年轻英语作家的两本新书中的故事背景所在。无论是《Fake Accounts》，这本曾经住在柏林的美国评论家Lauren Oyler的处女作，还是《In the End》，这本仍旧居住于此的英国作家和音乐家Musa Okwonga的作品，都不是真正写这个德国首都的。在这两本书中，都没有提及柏林的动荡历史，并且很不同寻常的是，也没有提及它的当代政治。相反， 柏林这座城市给了故事主人公所需要的空间，让他们去检验，去探寻自我。

3 The nameless American narrator of “Fake Accounts”, the more ambitious of the two, finds herself **in a bind**. Snooping through her boyfriend’s phone, she learns he has been **peddling** **outlandish** conspiracy theories to a large following on Instagram. Before she can ditch him, though, he dies in a bicycle accident. Shocked but also frustrated, **on a whim** she indulges what friends dismiss as the “**toolish** popular fantasy” of leaving New York for Berlin, where “you could come and go from life as you pleased,” and not be “obligated to act a certain way, or at all”.

> **in a bind**: 处于困境
>
> V-T[表不满]及物动词If someone **peddles** an idea or a piece of information, they try to get people to accept it. 散布 (某观点或信息)
>
> ADJ[表不满]形容词If you describe something as **outlandish**, you disapprove of it or find it funny because you think it is very unusual, strange, or unreasonable. 稀奇古怪的
>
> **toolish**: Idiotic, stupid, an add-on of the word "tool"
>
> e.g. When someone is acting like a tool, they are being toolish....
>
> **on a whim:** 一时兴起

> 作为两位主角中更有志气的那位，《Fake Accounts》中无名的记叙者，发现她正身处困境。在偷窥男朋友的手机时，她意识到男朋友正在Instagram上向他的众多粉丝散播稀奇古怪的阴谋论，但是，还没来得及甩掉他，他便死于一场自行车事故。震惊又受挫的她，脑子一热，开始沉溺于离开纽约前往柏林——这座可以“如你所愿来去随心的”，无需，“甚至完全不必以某种固定方式生活的城市”。而这个主意，朋友们都觉得是"很傻很天真的流行幻想"。

4 **Alienated** and aimless, she takes on low-wage work to support what becomes her main recreational activity: inventing fake personalities to try out on unsuspecting dates arranged online, whom she meets in bars in Neukölln or Kreuzberg. Not a lot happens (until, in the final chapter, it does). Social media, especially Twitter, both relieve and intensify her sense of isolation. The narrative begins to flit between the virtual and the “real”, teasing out the ways one interacts with and shapes the other. Berlin leaves her in peace as she pursues her **eccentric** projects.

> **alienated**: 疏远的；被疏远的
>
> ADJ形容词If you say that someone is **eccentric**, you mean that they behave in a strange way, and have habits or opinions that are different from those of most people. 古怪的; 异乎寻常的
>

> 举目无亲且漫无目标的她，从事着低薪工作以支撑她的主要娱乐活动：构建虚拟人格以测试网上认识的且毫不知情的约会对象，与他们在Neukolln和Kreuzberg的酒吧中见面。没有太多事情发生（除了在最后一章，确实发生了些什么 :p ），社交媒体（特别是Twitter）既缓解了、也加重了她的孤独感。讲述者开始在虚拟世界和“现实世界”中穿梭，梳理出一个人与对方互动并且塑造对方的方式。在她追逐这项古怪的事业时，柏林留予她宁静。

5“Fake Accounts”resolves the problem of how to render the online world in fiction without falling prey to technobabble or unreadability. Indeed, it is in part a rebuttal of the claim that modern technology has made old-fashioned fiction obsolete—for while it **grapples** with the contemporary challenges of social media, it also **dwells** on the traditional concerns of motivation and character. In long, **baggy** paragraphs, the narrator scrutinises her behaviour and beliefs and invites others to join in, from a **smart-alec** chorus of ex-boyfriends to the reader, whose approval is sought but whose assumptions are questioned at every turn.

> If you **grapple** **with** someone, you take hold of them and struggle with them, as part of a fight. You can also say that two people **grapple**. 与…扭打
>
> f you **dwell** **on** something, especially something unpleasant, you think, speak, or write about it a lot or for quite a long time. 细想; 详述
>
> If a piece of clothing is **baggy**, it hangs loosely on your body. 宽松的
>
> **smart -alec**: 自作聪明的人
>
> N-COUNT可数名词When there is a **chorus** **of** criticism, disapproval, or praise, that attitude is expressed by a lot of people at the same time. 齐声 (批评、反对或赞扬)
>
> at every term: 到处， 事事 adv
>

> 《Fake Account》解决了这样一个问题：如何将网络世界呈现在小说之内，同时不落入技术呓语或难以阅读的陷阱。事实上，小说某种程度上是对“现代科技已使守旧的小说显得过时”这种论调的驳斥——在它与来自社交媒体的当代挑战进行斗争的同时，也详细阐述了传统写法所关注的动机和人物性格。在冗长的章节中，叙述者仔细剖析她的表现和信仰，也邀请其它人加入这观察之中，从一群自作聪明的前男友到小说的读者都在其列。读者对其的赞许有迹可寻，但他们对情节的猜想处处都遭到质疑。

6 This playful approach, **reminiscent** of Twitter’s endless loops of attention-seeking and hot takes, will not appeal to everyone. But Ms Oyler’s writing is sharply observed and often uproariously funny—and behind her very-online jokes and **shaggy-dog stories** lies a serious account of a modern search for meaning and authenticity, in a city that can seem to offer little of either. From the **unadorned** harshness of its public spaces to its arresting light—which can turn “everything an eerie slate…like it had always just rained, or you had just cried”—she captures her version of Berlin.

> If you say that one thing is **reminiscent of** another, you mean that it reminds you of it. 令人想起的
>
> **hot takes**: a "piece of deliberately provocative commentary that is based almost entirely on shallow moralizing" in response to a news story, "usually written on tight deadlines with little research or reporting, and even less thought".
>
> **observe**: make a remark. 
>
> **shaggy-dog story** ：n.冗长无趣的笑话；剩皮狗的故事
>
> Something that is **unadorned** is plain, rather than having decoration on it. 未装饰的
>

> 这个好玩的尝试，让人们想起Twitter那无穷无尽的对注意力的追寻及热点的关注，这不会取悦于所有人。但Oyler的文风是锋锐可见的，也通常是非常有趣的——在她的网络段子和冗长的笑话故事背后，隐藏着一种对现代意义和真实性的探索的严肃记述，而这两者，柏林这个城市似乎都给予不了。从它公共空间毫无装饰的粗糙，到它刺眼的灯光——这灯光能将”所有东西变成一种恐怖的蓝灰石板色，好似它永远都是刚被雨淋湿，或是你刚哭过”——她捕捉到了属于她自己的柏林。

7 The narrator’s relationship with the city in Mr Okwonga’s carefully crafted novella runs deeper. He left London to be “as **innocuous** as a **cobblestone**” in Berlin, and is as successful as “a dark-skinned black man in an overwhelmingly white city” might dare to hope. The racism is persistent, but not disabling. Friendships are powerful, but cannot block out the loneliness. Online dating, this time earnest, turns out to be a “spectacular exercise in humility”. As for social media, the narrator’s therapist recommends that he cut down to reduce his anxiety levels. 

> Something that is **innocuous** is not at all harmful or offensive. 人畜无害的; 无意冒犯的
>
> **Cobblestones** are stones with a rounded upper surface which used to be used for making streets. (铺设街道用的) 圆形鹅卵石
>
> spectacular exercise in humility：（此处可能是）指网络上的低调炫耀、凡尔赛体

> 在Okwonga精心著作的中篇小说中，记叙者与这座城市的关系更为深沉。记叙者离开伦敦，想在柏林低调得"像一枚鹅卵石一样人畜无害”。并且他的成功达到了“全是白人的城市中的一个深色皮肤黑人”敢于设想的极限。种族主义一直都在，但并不会让人什么都做不了。友谊是很有用的，却也无法彻底阻隔孤独感。线上约会（这回是真诚的约会）变成了一场“大型凡尔赛文学练习场”。至于社交媒体，为降低记叙者的焦虑程度，他的心理治疗师建议他戒掉。

8 Expats in Berlin will find much to recognise in this book, from the **ecstasy** of the summers to the “friendships which never quite take root”. That is, until the final chapter, when the narrator makes a **pilgrimage** to rural Uganda, the land of his dead father. This experience, **steeped** in family and history, seems to fulfil his search for identity as Berlin never could. ■

> **Ecstasy** is a feeling of very great happiness. 狂喜
>
> If you make a **pilgrimage** to a holy place, you go there for a religious reason. 朝圣
>
> If a place or person is **steeped in** a quality or characteristic, they are surrounded by it or deeply influenced by it. 充满…的色彩; 深受…浸淫的
>

>  从夏日狂欢到“从未扎下根的友谊”，身处柏林的放逐者会在这本书中找到更多的认同之处。这种感觉持续到最后一章为止，在这一章中记叙者去了乌干达的农村朝圣，这是他已逝父亲的故土。这样一种浸透在家庭和历史中的经历，似乎满足了他对身份认同的追求，而这是柏林永远无法做到的。
