# DAY 7-session1 Death of an everyman
> The death of Li Wenliang has shaken China like an earthquake.He was a young doctor who was **reprimanded** by Chinese police for alerting colleagues to a new virus that has now killed more than

1,300 people, Dr Li among them (see Obituary). There was nationwide **soul-searching** when the **ophthalmologist** told Chinese media, days before his death on February 6th in Wuhan, Hubei province, that silencing truth-tellers can make a country sick. “I think
there should be more than one voice in a healthy society,” he said.

The country’s largest internet platforms have been placed under “special supervision” by cyber-regulators, with extra controls on anything resembling citizen journalism. Yet shows of authority cannot stop the public from **brooding** about Dr Li. As millions of Chinese read and share accounts of his short life and tragic death, they are being forced to devote unusual attention to their **social compact** with the country’s authoritarian rulers.
>
> Sometimes **adherence to** that compact seems almost painless—for instance last October, when many Chinese expressed deep, **unfeigned** pride on the 70th anniversary of a People’s Republic with **shiny** mega-cities, high-speed trains and aircraft-carriers that awe the world. **Unbidden**, many Chinese **credit** one-party rule with offering efficiency and stability, especially when democratic countries seem **mired** in **dysfunction**.
>
> Such confidence is harder now. Dr Li’s last weeks on Earth **oblige** his fellow citizens to confront the costs of a system without
>
> free speech, an uncensored press or independent legal system.
>
> Many have read the humiliating letter that police in Wuhan made
>
> him sign, agreeing that his truth-telling was in fact a lie that
>
> “**gravely** disturbed social order”. Not content with forcing the doctor to deny reality, police added school-bully phrases, asking him
>
> to write “I can” and “I understand” when asked if he would now
>
> calm down and **heed** the police, or face legal penalties.
>
> Lots of patriotic, law-abiding Chinese have **glimpsed** for themselves the casual, **swaggering sadism** of a system without accountability, in which the law is just another instrument for frightening the defenceless. They can see how, when agents of the state fear no external checks and balances, it is rational for them to bury bad news, right up until a crisis becomes too big to hide: a dynamic that builds instability into the way China is run.
