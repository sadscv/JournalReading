1 Perhaps they are two of the most welcome words in the English language: “Meeting cancelled”. When they cropped up in Bartleby’s message the other day, he experienced a brief moment of elation. In truth, the meeting turned out only to be postponed for two weeks, but procrastination is an underappreciated pleasure.

> “会议取消”，也许是人类语言中最受欢迎的字眼。一天，巴托比突然收到会议取消的讯息，他高兴了好一会。事实上，会议只是推迟了两周，但是拖延却能带来料想不到的快乐。

> cropped up：（常指出其不意地）出现，发生

> If something crops up, it appears or happens, usually unexpectedly.

2 Workers, and possibly all people, can be divided into two groups. Those who like to be involved in everything and can be dubbed “fomos” because they suffer from a “fear of missing out”. And then there are those who would ideally want to be left to get on with their own particular work, without distraction—the “jomos” (joy of missing out).

> 上班族自成两派，普通人大概也是这样。喜欢参与一切的人被称为“社交控”（FOMO），因为他们苦于“害怕错失”。另一些人喜欢独自完成个人工作，不受打搅，享受错失，他们被称为“独行侠”（JOMO）。

3 When The Economist moved offices in London in 2017, the new building came with a set of meeting spaces. As was inevitable, there are a lot more meetings. It is hard to walk by these gatherings without wondering who these people are and what they are doing. (It mostly seems to involve them gazing earnestly at a projection of a computer screen). Never once has Bartleby, who was born under the sign of jomo, wanted to join one of the groups.

> 2017年，《经济学人》伦敦办公室搬迁，崭新的大楼有成套的会议室。理所当然，会议的次数也增加了。多数时候，开会似乎就是大家认真地盯着电脑屏幕投影看，路过会议室，你会情不自禁地琢磨，开会的是哪些人，他们在忙些什么。但巴托比从未想过加入任何社交圈子，他骨子里就是个“独行侠”。

4 Readers will instantly know their tribe. If the boss announces a new project, do you immediately volunteer, thinking this will be a great chance to prove your skills? If so, you are a fomo. Or do you foresee the hassle involved, the likely failure of the project, and the weekend emails from all the fomos wanting to spend less time with their families? Then you are a certified jomo.

> 无需深思，读者便知道自己属于哪一门派。如果上司公布了一个新项目，你立即自告奋勇，认为这是一个证明自己实力的大好机会，那么你就是“社交控”。你要是预料到其中的麻烦，认为项目可能失败，又想到那群“社交控”不惜牺牲陪伴家人的时间，也要在周末给你发一堆邮件，那么你铁定是个“独行侠”。

5 Another test is technology. fomos are early adopters, snapping up the latest gadgets and sending documents to colleagues via the latest file-sharing programme. jomos tend to believe that any tech upgrade will be initially troublesome and wonder why on earth their colleagues can’t send the document as a pdf.

> 两派人对待新兴技术的态度也截然不同。“社交控”紧跟潮流，抢购最新产品；给同事发送文件时使用最新的文件共享程序。“独行侠”则认为任何技术的升级换代一开始都并不成熟，并且不能理解为什么同事不能老老实实发pdf文件。

> snapping up：抢购，赶紧买下（便宜或心仪之物）

> If you snap something up, you buy it quickly because it is cheap or is just what you want.

6 fomos relish the chance to take part in a video conference call so that they can share fully in the dynamics of the meeting and not miss any clues about the participants’ long-term agenda. jomos deeply resent the video element, which prevents them from checking their emails or playing solitaire while Ted drones on about budgets for 20 minutes.

> “社交控”把参加视频会议看作一种享受，因为他们可以将会议动态尽收眼底，绝不遗漏参会者关于长期议程的任何细节。“独行侠”却对视频会议恨之入骨，打开视频，他们既不能查收邮件，也不能玩纸牌接龙，只能听着泰德对预算问题絮絮叨叨20分钟。

7 Networking events are the kind of thing that gets fomos excited as a chance to exchange ideas and make contacts. When jomos hear the word “networking”, they reach for their noise-cancelling headphones. For them, being made to attend an industry cocktail party is rather like being obliged to attend the wedding of someone they barely know; an extended session of social purgatory.

> 参与社交活动时，“社交控”十分兴奋，因为他们能交流想法，建立联系。而一听社交二字，“独行侠”就想带上降噪耳机，对他们而言，被迫参加行业内鸡尾酒派对，不亚于被迫参加陌生人的婚礼，都是度秒如年的社交炼狱。

8 Similarly, fomos see a breakfast meeting as a chance to start the day on a positive note. They would hate to turn one down in case they lost business, or the chance of career advancement. jomos resent setting their alarm earlier and would rather breakfast at their kitchen table, grumbling about the news headlines to their spouse. If it is a work meeting, then hold it during working hours.

> 同样地，“社交控”认为，新的一天由早餐会议开始，是积极上进的象征。他们不愿拒绝他人，以防错失达成交易或升职加薪的机会。“独行侠”才不愿比往常更早起床，他们宁愿在厨房的饭桌解决早饭，对着另一半嘟囔几则新闻头条。工作会议就应该放在工作时间。

9 As for business travel, fomos can’t wait to experience the delight of overseas conferences and visiting new places. It will all look good on their curriculum vitae. jomos know that such travel involves cramped airline seats, jet lag and a long shuffle through immigration. The final destination tends not to be some exotic location but an identikit conference centre or hotel that they forget five minutes after they have departed.

> 谈及商务旅行，“社交控”迫不及待想要体验海外参会、游览异域的乐趣，这也能让他们的履历增色不少。“独行侠”则深知，出差意味着不得不忍受拥挤的航班座位，倒时差的疲惫，以及入境安检的长队。目的地往往看不到一点异国情调，经常是一个模子里刻出来的会议中心或酒店，离开5分钟就忘得一干二净。

10 JONMOS recognise that they have to attend some meetings and go on trips to get their work done. But they regard such things as a penance not a privilege. Something useful may come out of it, but best not to get their hopes up.

> 要完成工作，必须参加一些会议，出几次差，这一点“独行侠”也认同。但是他们认为这是一种苦差，而不是荣幸。他们或许能从中获得点有用的东西，但是这也不能让他们对开会出差抱有期望。
>
> Penance：补赎，悔罪，忏悔
>
> If you do penance for something wrong that you have done, you do something that you find unpleasant to show that you are sorry.

11 It might seem obvious that employers should look to hire fomos, not their opposites. After all, in a company full of jomos, sales might suffer and there would be little innovation. But while fomos are racing from meeting to networking event, you need a few jomos to be doing actual work. If fomos are like dogs, barking excitedly and chasing their own tails, jomos are more feline. They will spring into action if a mouse is in the vicinity but, in the meantime, they are content to sit by the fire.

> 雇主应雇佣“社交控”，而非“独行侠”，这一点似乎显而易见。毕竟，由“独行侠”组成的公司里，销售业绩大概不乐观，创新成果也屈指可数。然而，当“社交控”在会议和社交活动之间穿梭忙碌时，公司就需要一些“独行侠”来踏实完成工作。如果把“社交控”比作兴奋狂吠、追着自己尾巴转圈的犬类，“独行侠”则更像猫科动物，一见附近有老鼠就立即上前捕捉，平时便独自倚坐在炉火边自得其乐。
>

12 The other reason why depending on fomos is dangerous is that they are naturally restless. JOMOS will be loyal, for fear of ending up with a worse employer. But FOMOs may think that working for one company means they are missing out on better conditions at another. That is the point of most networking, after all.

> 全盘依靠“社交控”有风险的另一个原因是他们天生不知足。“独行侠”懂得安定，担心跳槽会遇到更难相处的上司。但是“社交控”可能认为给一家公司工作意味着错失更好的工作条件，毕竟那样才可以实现最广泛的社交。
