# D772 In praise of mass-market American tacos

1 A certain type of big-city eater—including, sometimes, the author of this column—reflexively assumes that noodles eaten at a restaurant without an English menu are, by definition, superior to those from a **strip-mall** outlet catering to non-Chinese diners. Such people are liable also to think that non-Italian ingredients have no place on a pizza, or that using Italian rather than **Tunisian** olive oil in **couscous** is a grave culinary sin.

2 A taco, these diners will explain (often without being asked), consists of paired soft **tortilla**s, typically made of corn. These are wrapped around a modest amount of meat, usually braised, with a sprinkling of chopped raw onion, a couple of **sprig**s of coriander and a **squirt** of **salsa**—the spicier the better. Made well, these are indeed delicious, with an almost Japanese **austerity** that lets every ingredient shine and complement each other.

3 What **innumerable** Americans know as a taco—a hard-shell tortilla that comes in boxes on grocery shelves, stuffed to bursting with ground meat cooked in mass-market seasoning, topped with **orangey** mass-produced cheese, **iceberg lettuce**, tomatoes and mild salsa from a jar—bears little relation to this “real thing”. So, the authenticity-policing diners argue, it should be **shun**ned and mocked.

4 This is a joyless way to eat. **Chubby,** crackly American tacos may be unknown in Culiacán or Toluca, but they taste good. They may well seem “inauthentic” in Mexico, but they are deeply authentic in the minds and memories of millions in America. Korean tacos—tortillas filled with Korean-seasoned barbecued meat and **kimchi**—are also little known in Mexico. But they emerged authentically from the marriage of Korean and Mexican cultures and cuisines in multicultural Los Angeles.

5 That is how food develops. Being the original **progenitor** of a recipe may merit some bragging rights at the dining table, but nothing more. Legend has it that Marco Polo brought noodles back to Italy from China: that does not make spaghetti just **bastardised** lamian, except in the way that all foods (and people) are hybrid and **derivative**. Lebanese emigrants brought lamb cooked upright on a rotating spit with them to Mexico. Decades and countless chillies, onions and pineapples later, Mexicans turned **shawarma** into tacos al pastor.

6 Judging dishes by their authenticity ignores t

> he development that follows naturally as food and people migrate. It also encourages unwelcome stereotyping. In 2019 Sara Kay, a culinary consultant, studied 20,000 online reviews of restaurants in New York, and found “authentic” to be associated with “dirt floors [and] plastic **stools**” when describing non-European restaurants. For European **eateries**, it meant elegant **decor.**

> **eatery**:小餐馆
>
> **decor.**:装饰风格

7 That exemplifies the common but **regrettable** belief that non-European food should be cheap and served in **tatty** surroundings—even when the cuisines **in question** are **intricate** and delicious. In the end, whether someone considers a food authentic says more about their own biases than about what is on their plate. ■
