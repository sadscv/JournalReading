# D277+D278 Beethoven’s triumphant career was a struggle against adversity
1 In december 1808 Ludwig van Beethoven amazed Vienna with a four-hour, self-promoted concert. It included **premieres** of his Fifth and Sixth **symphonies**, and of his Fourth Piano Concerto. Shortly afterwards the **gruff** **maestro** seemed to have crowned his long search for a stable income with an **annuity** worth 4,000 **florins** from Archduke Rudolph of Austria and two other **aristocrats**. He contemplated marriage and set to work on his next **concerto**.

> 这段讲述了贝多芬1808年12月在维也纳的光辉时刻，以及他准备过安稳生活的打算。

2 Then Napoleon Bonaparte’s forces attacked and occupied the city for the second time in four years. Beethoven, who lived in the line of fire, **cowered** in his brother’s basement as he tried to protect his already damaged hearing from the **din**. Worse, his **patrons** failed to pay up. Distraught and anxious, he wrote of the “destructive, disorderly life” around him, “nothing but drums, **cannons** and human misery”.

> 可天不遂人愿。拿破仑打破了这份宁静，带来了连年战火。听力本就不好的贝多芬，可怜巴巴的躲在了地下室，无比抓狂。鼓声急，炮声响，人间疾苦环绕，人生黯淡无光。

3 Beethoven was born 250 years ago (his exact birthday is uncertain). Almost from the time he left his native Bonn for Vienna in 1792, setbacks disrupted the keyboard **virtuoso**’s promising career. Hearing loss struck in 1798, not a quiet slide into silence but an **incessant** “**squealing**, **buzzing** and **humming**” in the ears. In 1802 he considered suicide, writing that “it was only my art that held me back”.

> 生于250年前的贝多芬，人生如此多艰。自从1792年离开老家伯恩，到了维也纳，生活一直都不顺。1798年双耳失聪，如果真是安安静静的倒算了，更糟糕的是，耳朵里经常有滋滋嗡嗡的声音。1802年，他想过自杀，写道：“只是我的艺术阻止了我（自杀）”。
>

4 Yet that art quickly mastered the formal beauty and decorum of Haydn and Mozart before moving into an entirely new **realm** of innovation and unshackled self-expression. Completed in 1804, his Third Symphony, the “Eroica”, broadcast this leap to a thunderstruck public, alarming some listeners (“**strident** and bizarre”), transfixing others (“true genius”). By 1810 the Fifth Symphony was being hailed as a landmark in world culture—a **gospel** of Romantic feeling that “opens up to us the kingdom of the gigantic and the immeasurable”.

> 1804年，他创作英雄交响曲，才华惊艳众人。1810年的时候，英雄交响曲已成为某种意义上世界文化的标杆。

5 Knock him down, and Beethoven would bounce back with another **stupendous** **coup**. By 1824 the critic Adolph Marx could write that the composer’s style **bore witness to** “the struggle of a strong being against an almost overwhelming fate”. It is fitting, then, that the global celebrations of his **jubilee** have been marked by dismay, resilience and **resurrection**.

> 贝多芬本是一个抗挫折能力很好的人，所以全球关于他的庆祝活动都是以苦难，抗争，复兴等为主题。

> bear witness to:证明

6 The festivities began before the pandemic struck. Based in Bonn, the bthvn250 programme scheduled hundreds of events in Germany. Vienna, where Beethoven lived without much affection for 35 years—“From the emperor to the bootblack, all the Viennese are worthless”—forgave the **slights** to offer exhibitions and concerts **galore**. In Brazil Marin Alsop, an American conductor, launched her “Global **Ode** to Joy” project, planned performances of the heaven-storming Ninth Symphony on six continents. Opera houses prepared to **raise the curtain on** “Fidelio”, Beethoven’s only opera and an **evergreen** hymn to freedom. “Oh what bliss, to breathe freely in the open air,” sing a **chorus** of prisoners, in a scene to melt the iciest heart. Then they return to their cells.

> raise the curtain on:揭露，公开，开始做

7 This spring, the whole world followed them. Lockdowns forced the anniversary **ringmasters** to tear up their plans. “Beethoven had to reinvent himself again and again,” notes Malte Boecker, director of bthvn250. His **acolytes** followed suit. Events were postponed; performances moved online. Yet “audience numbers grew and grew. It became like a snowball,” says Mr Boecker. The “Beethoven **Pastoral** Project”, inspired by his bucolic Sixth Symphony, became a virtual network of artists, already reaching a global audience of 30m.

> 今年春天，世界其他地方也举办了类似的活动。疫情让原有的计划泡汤了，活动推迟，演出搬到线上，但观众却越来越多。

8 The composer would have winced in recognition. The chronic insecurity faced by musicians today is “very close to the situation in Beethoven’s time”, Mr Boecker notes. War with France **raged with** little **respite** from 1792 to 1815; inflation shrank earnings; publishers, promoters and patrons went bust. Laura Tunbridge, professor of music at Oxford and author of a new biography, “Beethoven: A Life in Nine Pieces”, underlines her subject’s role as “one of the early freelancers”, a **hard-nosed** jobbing professional.

9 **Lurching** between court and market, prosperity and penury, he worked **on the cusp** between the old musical regime of noble and royal **patronage**, and the new order of commercial publishing and concert promotion. Between 1809 and 1812 he earned 6,000 florins a year, six times an average civil-service salary. But he ran through it fast and complained that “I have not a **farthing** left.” His grandest pieces, such as the Ninth Symphony and “Missa Solemnis”, are timeless monuments to genius. They were also properties that Beethoven pitched aggressively (and often simultaneously) to rival publishers. Those two went to Schott and Sons of Mainz for 1,600 florins.

> 讲贝多芬如何应对困境：在贵族与皇室庇护的旧音乐体制下和商业出版与演奏会推广的新秩序下寻求平衡（1809-1812年年收入是公务员的6倍）；把自己的作品竞价卖给竞争对手获取高额收入

> He let the **snobby** Viennese presume the “van” in his Flemish surname denoted noble descent. (It didn’t.) But he **despised** most aristocrats and, embracing his celebrity status, was not shy about telling them. “Of princes there have been and will be thousands,” he wrote to Prince Lichnowsky, one of his patrons, after a quarrel. “Of Beethovens there is only one.” When he and Goethe encountered Austrian royalty at a **Bohemian** spa, Goethe **doffed** his hat and bowed; Beethoven **strode on**, telling the superstar author, “You did those **yonder** too much honour.” Like many other children of the Enlightenment, he was filled with hope, then rage, by Napoleon’s ascent from the chaos of post-revolutionary France. Famously and furiously, he scratched out the dedication of the “Eroica” to Napoleon when the Corsican declared himself emperor.
>
> 贝多芬也是挺有技巧的。他让势力的维也纳人误以为他姓中的van是贵族的象征（其实不是）。他看不起贵族，并且敢于告诉他们。一次他在信中写道，贵族千千万万，可贝多芬只有一个。
>
> 像其他生活在启蒙期间的孩子，他充满着希望，但又盛怒于拿破仑在法国革命后的崛起。这个故事很出名，在这个科西嘉人（拿破仑）宣称自己为国王时，贝多芬把对拿破仑的献词从英雄交响曲里划掉了。

11 Like America’s Founding Fathers, Beethoven was a republican idealist, not a modern democrat. He once said that he “never believed” in the **dictum** “Vox populi, vox Dei” (“The people’s voice is the voice of God”). To the ears of **posterity**, though, Beethoven’s music means heroic liberation and human solidarity. The **ominous** blows that launch the Fifth Symphony became the Morse-code “V” for victory during the second world war. Leonard Bernstein conducted the Ninth in Berlin as the Wall came down in 1989.

> 1941年6月27日，英国广播公司（BBC）以贝多芬第五交响曲的开头四个音符作为摩尔斯密码向被德国纳粹占领的欧洲地区传达希望。按照乐曲的节奏，该密码为···—，代表了胜利Victory的首位字母V。

> 永远值得纪念的是1989年12月23日和12月25日两天，伯恩斯坦在钢琴家朱斯图斯·弗朗兹的邀请下到柏林指挥        贝多芬第九交响曲        ，地点分别是柏林爱乐厅和音乐会堂，由Unitel摄影。当时正值柏林墙倒下，伯恩斯坦将交响曲中席勒的        欢乐颂        改为“自由颂”。伯恩斯坦对此说道：“我肯定，贝多芬会同意咱们这么做的”。超过20个国家，一亿人通过电视转播收看了这场音乐会。

12 Now, with massed **choirs** banned on health grounds, such barnstorming showpieces remain unstageable in Europe. **In place of** the towering **icon**, an intimate, informal Beethoven has flourished during his plague-hit jubilee year. Ms Tunbridge notes the vogue for small-scale arrangements of his music. Igor Levit, a pianist, has gathered a worldwide audience for concerts streamed from his flat in Berlin.

> in place of :代替 alternative

> 如今，受疫情期间社交隔离的影响，大规模的演出也不知什么时候可以恢复(unstageable)。而另一种模式的纪念贝多芬活动正在兴起。

13 On December 17th—the date of Beethoven’s **baptism** in 1770—Daniel Barenboim is due to conduct the West-Eastern Divan Orchestra in Bonn; bthvn250 hopes that this flagship concert can go ahead, now as a **prelude** to delayed commemorations rather than a **climax**. Suntory Hall in Tokyo still promises several performances of the “Daiku” (Number Nine), which German **pows** introduced to Japan in 1918. But as an anniversary **anthem** in these **queasy**, isolated times, Mr Boecker recommends not the ecstatic joy of the Ninth but the humbler “Heiliger Dankgesang”—the heartfelt “song of thanksgiving” from a late string quartet, composed during **convalescence**. Fate has amplified Beethoven’s voice not as a struggler, but as a healer.

> 全世界也在继续筹备着纪念贝多芬的活动。在贝多芬的家乡伯恩，在12月17号将有一场著名钢琴家丹尼尔·巴伦博伊姆的音乐会。 日本的三得利音乐厅也承诺会有几场Number Nine演出 （Number Nine基调挺欢快的）。但贝多芬250周年纪念活动的总策划指出，这可能有点不太合时宜了吧？还是换成Heiliger Dankgesang （song of thanksgiving）更应景。这就是命运，疫情时代赋予了贝多芬另外一重身份，他不仅仅是一个自我奋斗者，而且是能抚平他人创伤的人。
