# DAY 13 The Qualcommunist manifesto
1 If imitation is the best form of flattery, one can only imagine the mandarins in Beijing blushing bashfully on February 6th as they eavesdropped on William Barr, America’s **attorney-general**, firing the latest shots in the tech cold war. One of America’s main concerns, he told a **think-tank** in Washington, dc, was Chinese dominance of fifth-generation (5g) wireless technology by Huawei. It had achieved this with totalitarian central planning. “As a dictatorship”, he said, “China can marshal an all-nation approach—the government, its companies, its academia, acting together as one.”

2 Mr Barr’s response to this threat? Central planning, also involving the state, business and academia, but in support of American goals, not Chinese ones. He said America and its **allies** should decide which “horse we’re going to ride in this race”. That might mean, he went on, that America’s government or its companies should buy controlling stakes in Huawei’s European rivals, Finland’s Nokia, Sweden’s Ericsson, or both—despite there being no precedent for such a move (at least one that does not involve covert operations). It also meant public and private sectors **standing shoulder to shoulder against** China’s technological **blitzkrieg**.

3 Call it state **capitalism**, American-style. In full 5g panic, President Donald Trump’s **administration** wants to **co-opt** not just other
countries’ national champions, but **domestic** ones, too. One focus
of attention is **Qualcomm**. The company, which is based in San
Diego and worth $103bn, is among the world’s biggest 5g chipmakers. In 2018 it received unusual government support, when Mr
Trump blocked its takeover by Broadcom, then a Singapore-based
rival, on national-security grounds. As The Economist went to press
on February 13th, it was due a second round of state-backed reinforcement, this time in a San Francisco courtroom where it is appealing against a landmark antitrust verdict. Its backer was Mr
Barr’s Department of Justice (doj).

4 Qualcomm’s relations with the government reveal a lot about
the way America is fighting the battle for global supremacy in technology. The Trump administration has two main national-security
concerns about 5g. The first revolves around the public telecoms
networks. It worries that kit installed by Huawei, which boasts a

30% market share in 5g and is in most places bar America, could be
used for surveillance. Huawei insists it will never be. But news reports this week said American officials believe it can access mobile
networks via “back doors” meant solely for law enforcement. Nokia and Ericsson are among the next-biggest makers of 5g kit but
they lack Huawei’s financial firepower. A deep-pocketed American
rival like Qualcomm or Cisco could in principle bolster their balance-sheets. But they show no appetite for building fiddly, lowmargin 5g networks.

5 The government’s second worry is about micro-industrial networks, which is where Qualcomm could play a role. The administration argues that within five years 5g could become the backbone
of a vast economic system in which everything from cars to factories to fridges seamlessly streams limitless information. It fears
that a dominant China could jam them, monopolise them or suck
up all the data they produce for its own artificial intelligence. Qualcomm hopes its modems used in 5g devices, and the licences on its
patents, will enable customers around the world to build a web of
private 5g networks in this “industrial internet”. But it will have to
remain competitive against Huawei, which also makes modems
and licenses technology.

6 So far Qualcomm’s bets on 5g have been ahead of the competition. But its ambitions have been undermined by repeated allegations that it is a monopolist. It was in court this week appealing against an antitrust verdict in a case brought by the Federal Trade Commission (ftc) under Barack Obama. The ftc took aim at a lucrative licensing model that 5g could further strengthen. It is a sign of the Trump administration’s alarm about Qualcomm’s future that the DOJ (Deaprtment of Justice), supported by the Pentagon and the Department of Energy, is throwing its weight behind the firm’s appeal—on national-security grounds. Hence the strange spectacle of two trustbusting agencies battling each other in court.

7 The doj’s backing may bolster Qualcomm’s case. Much of the
national-security argument, though, is rather nebulous. The doj
argues that a verdict against Qualcomm forcing it to renegotiate its
licence fees with customers could hit profits and hamper its ability
to innovate, which would put America itself at risk. Yet the lack of
competition could be a bigger threat to innovation.

8 The case highlights a deeper question about America’s approach to 5g. How urgent is it to reduce China’s technological lead?
Some advise patience, and think much of the hysteria is a veiled
justification for protectionism. At present, 5g capabilities are little
different from superfast 4g, and as yet the applications do not exist to make the most of the industrial internet. There is still time
for experiment and innovation. Alternatives to Huawei’s hardware-heavy, vertically integrated networks are emerging. Companies in America, Europe and elsewhere are using their strengths in
software to build virtual networks that are more open and decentralised. Qualcomm is eyeing such opportunities hungrily, and
plans to sell chips for virtualised 5g networks as well as devices.

9 Mr Barr, who has mixed a career in government with one in telecoms, argues that all this would take too long to counter the clear
and present threat from China. The message is unambiguous. If
only America could play by China’s rules, subsidising domestic
champions and hobbling foreign rivals, it could win in 5g. That is a
counsel of despair. Qualcomm and other firms may happily lap up
government support. They would benefit, too, from an overdue infrastructure upgrade. But ultimately America’s greatest industrial
strength is its freewheeling spirit. Rewriting the rules of American
capitalism with Chinese characters would not help that at all.
