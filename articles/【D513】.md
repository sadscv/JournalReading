1 Many visitors only **skim** the surface of the ocean—swimming from the beach or **slicing through whitecaps** on a sailing boat. In “The Brilliant **Abyss**”, Helen Scales, a marine biologist whose previous books explored the shallower reaches of the sea, dives deep and revealingly into the **realm** below 660 feet where sunlit blue begins to give way to black.

2 As Ms Scales notes, it is often said that more is known of the Moon’s surface, exposed to anyone with a telescope, than about the geography of the deep-sea floor, which a dark **cloak** of water obscures. It is a **rugged**, complex and shifting terrain—subject to earthquakes **precipitated** by the movement of **tectonic plates**, and punctuated by **seamounts** (mountains formed by volcanic activity) and **hydrothermal vents** that emit sulphurous, **scalding** fluids.

3 In these underwater extremes of dark and cold, and the boiling waters **disgorged** by vents, life survives and even thrives. It includes sea cucumbers that **slough off** their illuminated skin to distract predators, **yeti crabs** as hairy as their name suggests, fish masked in ultra-black skin that makes them all but invisible, and a sponge that looks like a glass of milk frozen in **mid-spill**. As well as its role as a climate regulator and **carbon sink,** the deep, in its **vibrant profusion**, prompts reflections on the possibility of life on other planets.

4 Less **beguiling** things **lurk** down there too. Plastic bags and packaging have been spotted by **submersibles** in the seven-mile-deep Mariana Trench. Nuclear waste, chemicals and oil spills, such as the one from the Deepwater Horizon **rig** in 2010, have turned sections of sea floor into poisonous dumps. Exploitation adds to the **blight**. The orange roughy, a white-fleshed fish that congregates around seamounts (also known, less appetisingly, as a **slimehead**) has been dangerously overfished.

5 An experimental push to harvest sea-floor **nodules** laced with manganese, nickel, cobalt and other metals is another threat. The potential damage to the seabed from remotely operated machines is **analogous**, Ms Scales argues, to the most toxic mining on dry land. But the revenues could be huge. An analysis by the Massachusetts Institute of Technology calculated that a single seabed mine could net $1bn a year.

6 And an ecological case for the initiative can be made. “I get very uncomfortable when people describe us as deep-sea miners,” says Gerard Barron of DeepGreen Metals, a deep-sea mining company targeting the metals used in electric-car batteries. “We want to help the world transition away from fossil fuels.” Because the long-term impact is unknown, Ms Scales is sceptical; her argument is compelling, even if her explanation of car batteries is a **slog**. Yet another marine biologist doubts that mining would be **forestalled** “even if we found unicorns on the sea floor”.

7 Early European **cartographers** often used **sea serpent**s to mark **uncharted** depths. Hic sunt dracones—Here be dragons—reads the inscription flagging an **unfathomable** stretch of water on a globe made in 1510. But the most threatening sea monster of all may be man. ■
