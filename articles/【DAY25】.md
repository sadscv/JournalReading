# DAY 25 Do not rely on facial expressions for how people are feeling
> 微笑并不总代表着幸福
 > 

1 ARISTOTLE RECKONED the face was a window onto a person's mind. Cicero agreed. Two millennia on, facial expressions are still commonly thought to be a universally valid way to **gauge** other people's feelings, irrespective of age, sex and culture. A raised eyebrow suggests confusion. A smile denotes happiness. A frown indicates sadness.

> 古希腊哲学家亚里士多德(Aristotle)主张可以透过一个人的面部表情来知晓他的想法。对此，古罗马哲学家西塞罗(Cicero)表示赞同。自此两千多年来，通过他人的面部表情来判断其情绪被视作一种普遍有效的方式，不论他们的年龄、性别和文化背景。人们认为，挑眉代表困惑，微笑代表幸福，而蹙额代表悲伤。

2 Or do they? An analysis of hundreds of research papers that examined the relationship between facial expressions and underlying emotions has uncovered a surprising conclusion: there is no good scientific evidence to suggest that there are such things as recognisable facial expressions for basic emotions which are universal across culture. Just because a person is not smiling, the researchers found, does not mean that person is unhappy.

> 情况果真如此吗?在分析了数千份研究面部表情与隐含情绪之间的关系的报告之后，研究人员得出了一个惊人的结论: 没有充分的科学证据表明，我们可以通过面部表情来对他人进行跨越文化的基本情绪的识别。研究人员发现，我们不能仅仅因为一个人没有微笑就判断他过得不幸福。

3 As Lisa Feldman Barrett, one of the authors of the study published in Psychological Science in the Public Interest, told the AAAS meeting in Seatle," We surprised ourselves". Dr Feldman Barrett is a psychologist at Northeastern University in Boston, Massachusetts, and along with her colleagues she found that, on average, adults in urban culture **scowled** when they were angry 30% of the time. Which meant that some 70% of the time they did not scowl when angry. Instead, they did something else with their faces. People also scowled when they were not angry."They scowl when they're concentrating, they scowl when someone tells them a bad joke, they scowl when they have gas, they scowl for lots of reasons," says Dr Feldman Barrett.

> 正如来自美国东北大学的心理学教授、此次研究的作者之一，丽莎·费尔德曼·巴雷特女士(Lisa Feldman Barrett)于在西雅图举行的美国科学促进会年会上说的那样，“我们对此也感到吃惊”。她和同事在研究中发现，平均而言，生活在城市文化里的成年人在感到愤怒时，有 30%的时间会皱眉，这就意味着有 70%的时间，他们不会皱眉，相反的，而会呈现出皱眉以外的面部表情。另外，人们也会其他情况下皱眉。比如巴雷特女士提到的，“当人们集中注意力，或听到一个糟糕的笑话，亦或是他们放屁时，他们会皱眉。”

4 A scowl, the researchers concluded, is certainly one expression of anger. But it is not the only way people express that emotion. The ambiguous nature of facial expressions was not restricted to anger, but seemed valid for all six of the emotional categories that they examined: anger, disgust, fear, happiness, sadness and surprise.

> 对此研究人员总结道，皱眉的确是人们表现愤怒的一种表情，但绝不是唯一一种。这种模棱两可的表达方式似乎不仅局限于愤怒这一情绪上，而是几乎对他们研究的所有六种情绪类别都适用，即愤怒，厌恶，恐惧，幸福，悲伤和惊讶。

5 All this raises questions about the efforts of information-technology companies to develop artificial-intelligence algorithms which can recognise facial expressions and work out a person's underlying emotional state. Microsoft, for example, claims its "Emotion API" is able to detect what people are feeling by examining video footage of them. Another of the study authors, however, expressed scepticism. Aleix Martinez, a computer engineer at Ohio State University, said that companies attempting to extract emotions from image of faces have failed to understand the importance of context.

> 以上所有的结论引起了人们对信息技术公司的质疑，这些公司试图研发能够通过识别人的面部表情从而确定他的情绪状态的人工智能算法。例如，微软就声称其公司研发的情绪识别 API 能够通过分析照片上人的面部表情来确定他们内心的情绪状态。然而，该项研究的另一位作者，来自俄亥俄州立大学电气与计算机工程系的亚历克斯·马丁内斯教授对此持怀疑态度，他认为那些想单凭计算机提取人脸图像信息便确定其情绪的公司，并没有意识到情境对情绪解读起到的作用。

6 For a start, facial expression is but one of a number of non-verbal **cues**, such as body posture, that people use to communicate with each other. Machine recognition of emotion needs to take account of these as well. But context can reach further than that. Dr Martinez cited an experiment in which participants were shown a close-up picture of a man's face, which was bright red with his mouth open in a scream.

> 首先，面部表情只是人们用来交流的许多非语言线索之一，类似的非语言线索还有肢体动作等。因此，人们在利用机器识别情绪时也应将其它非语言线索考虑在内。但情境对影响我们对他人情绪的认识远不止如此。马丁内斯教授提到在一次实验中，实验人员向参与者展示一个男人面部的特写镜头，图片中男人脸色通红，嘴巴大张呈呼喊状。

7 Based on this alone, most participants said the man was extremely angry. Then the view **zoomed out** to show a football player with his arms outstretched, celebrating a goal. His angry-looking face was, in fact, a show of pure joy.

> 单从这张图片出发，绝大多数的参与者都猜测这个男人极其愤怒。之后，实验人员将图片还原，大家发现图中的一个足球运动员展开双臂庆祝进球的情景。他那张看似愤怒的表情，实际上表达的是纯粹的快乐。

8 Given that people cannot guess each other's emotional states most of the time, Dr Martinez sees no reason computers would be able to."There are computers right now claiming to be able to do that and apply this to places I find really scary and dangerous, for example, in hiring people," he says."Some companies require you to submit a video CV, and then this is analysed by a machine-learning system. And depending on your facial expressions, they hire you or not, which I find really **stunning** and not only based on the wrong hypothesis, but a dangerous hypothesis."

> 在大多数情况下人们无法识别出别人的情绪状态，基于这点，马丁内斯教授并不认为计算机能够做到。他提到，“现在有很多公司宣称他们能够做到机器识别情绪并将其应用到一些我认为非常可怕危险的领域。比方说，有些公司会要求应聘者提交一份视频简历，然后公司会利用机器分析系统来对应聘者的情绪进行分析。最后，公司就依据应聘者的面部表情决定是否录用。对此我感到十分震惊，因为公司的这种做法不仅是建立在一种错误的假设上，更是建立在一种危险的假设上。
