1 On August 29th, as Hurricane Dorian tracked towards America’s East coast, Elon Musk, the boss of Tesla, an electric-car maker, announced that some of his customers in the storm’s path would find that their cars had suddenly developed the ability to drive farther on a single battery charge. Like many modern vehicles, Mr Musk’s products are best thought of as internet-connected computers on wheels. The cheaper models in Tesla’s line-up have parts of their batteries disabled by the car’s software in order to limit their range. At the tap of a keyboard in Palo Alto, the firm was able to remove those restrictions and give drivers temporary access to the full power of their batteries.

> 8 月 29 日，当飓风多里安向美国东海岸移动时，电动汽车制造者，特斯拉的老板埃隆·马斯克宣布，在风暴路径上的一些客户将会发现，他们的汽车突然拥有了单次充电就能行驶更远的能力。和许多现代汽车一样，马斯克的产品被认为是最好的带轮子的联网电脑。特斯拉系列中价格较低的车型，为了限制续航里程，部分电池被其软件禁用。只要在帕洛阿尔托敲击一下键盘，这家公司就能解除这些限制，让司机暂时用上电池的全部电力。

2 Mr Musk’s computerised cars are just one example of a much broader trend. As computers and connectivity become cheaper, it makes sense to bake them into more and more things that are not, in themselves, computers—from nappies and coffee machines to cows and factory robots—creating an “internet of things”, or IoT . It is a slow revolution that has been gathering pace for years, as computers have found their way into cars, telephones and televisions. But the transformation is about to go into overdrive. One forecast is that by 2035 the world will have a trillion connected computers, built into everything from food packaging to bridges and clothes.

> 马斯克的电脑化汽车只是更广泛前景中的一个例子。随着计算机和联网的成本降低，越来越多不具有计算机功能的家用产品被植入了计算机和联网功能——从尿布、咖啡机到奶牛和工厂机器人——进而创造出出了一个“物联网”，简称IoT。这是一场缓慢的革命，多年来一直在加快步伐，因为电脑已经进入汽车、电话和电视领域。但这种转变即将进入超速阶段 (overdrive)。一项预测是，到2035年，全球将有一万亿台联网电脑，从食品包装到桥梁和服装，无所不包。

3 Such a world will bring many benefits. Consumers will get convenience, and products that can do things non-computerised versions cannot. Amazon’s Ring smart doorbells, for instance, come equipped with motion sensors and video cameras. Working together, they can also form what is, in effect, a private CCTV network, allowing the firm to offer its customers a “digital neighbourhood-watch” scheme and pass any interesting video along to the police.

> 万物互联大有裨益。消费者将得到便利，而产品能做的事情，是非计算机版本的产品无法做到的。例如，亚马逊的智能门铃就配有运动传感器和摄像机。通过合作，他们还可以组成一个实际上的私人闭路电视网络，让公司为客户提供一个“数字邻居观看”计划，并将任何有趣的视频传递给警方。

4 Businesses will get efficiency, as information about the physical world that used to be **ephemeral** and uncertain becomes concrete and analysable. Smart lighting in buildings saves energy. Computerised machinery can predict its own breakdowns and schedule preventive maintenance. Connected cows can have their eating habits and vital signs tracked in real time, which means they produce more milk and require less medicine when they fall ill. Such gains are individually small but, compounded again and again across an economy, they are the raw material of growth—potentially a great deal of it.

> 随着过去短暂 (ephemeral)而不确定的物理世界的信息变得具体而可分析，企业将获得效率。建筑物内的智能照明节省能源。计算机化的机器可以预测自己的故障并安排预防性维修。相互连接的奶牛可以实时跟踪它们的饮食习惯和生命体征，这意味着它们产奶更多，生病时需要的药物更少。这些收益个别来说很小，但是在一个经济体中不断地复合 (compounded)，它们是增长的原材料—潜在的可大量增长。

5 In the long term, though, the most conspicuous effects of the IoT will be in how the world works. One way to think of it is as the second phase of the internet. This will carry with it the business models that have come to dominate the first phase—all-conquering “platform” monopolies, for instance, or the data-driven approach that critics call “surveillance capitalism”. Ever more companies will become tech companies; the internet will become all-pervasive. As a result, a series of unresolved arguments about ownership, data, surveillance, competition and security will spill over from the virtual world into the real one.

> 然而，从长远来看，物联网最引人注目的 (conspicuous)影响将是世界如何运转。可以把它看作互联网的第二阶段。这将带来一些商业模式，例如，这些商业模式已经主导了第一阶段的所向无敌的“平台”垄断，或批评者称之为“监控资本主义”的数据驱动方式。越来越多的公司将成为科技公司;互联网将变得无处不在。因此，关于所有权、数据、监控、竞争和安全的一系列悬而未决的争论将从虚拟世界蔓延到现实世界。

6 Start with ownership. As Mr Musk showed, the internet gives firms the ability to stay connected to their products even after they have been sold, transforming them into something closer to services than goods. That has already **blurred** traditional ideas of ownership. When Microsoft closed its ebook store in July, for instance, its customers lost the ability to read titles they had bought (the firm offered refunds). Some early adopters of “smart home” gadgets have found that they ceased to work after the firms that made them lost interest.

> 首先谈论所有权。正如马斯克所展示的那样，互联网让企业有能力在产品售出后仍能与之保持联系，使它们更接近于服务，而非商品。这已经模糊了传统的所有权观念。例如，当微软在 7 月份关闭其电子书商店时，它的顾客失去了阅读他们所购买书籍的能力(该公司提供退款)。一些“智能家居”设备的早期使用者发现，在让他们失去兴趣的公司倒闭后，这些设备就停止了工作。

7 That tilts the balance of power from the customer to the seller. John Deere, an American maker of high-tech tractors, has been embroiled in a row over software restrictions that prevent its customers from repairing their tractors themselves. And since software is not sold but licensed, the firm has even argued that, in some circumstances, a tractor-buyer may not be buying a product at all, instead receiving only a licence to operate it.

> 这样就把权力的天平从客户那里倾斜到了卖家那里。美国高科技拖拉机制造商约翰迪尔(John Deere)卷入了一场软件限制的纠纷，这些软件限制使其客户无法自己修理拖拉机。而且，由于软件不是出售而是授权的，该公司甚至辩称，在某些情况下，拖拉机买家可能根本就没有购买产品，而只是获得了操作该产品的授权。

8 Virtual business models will jar in the physical world. Tech firms are generally happy to move fast and break things. But you cannot release the beta version of a fridge. Apple, a smartphone-maker, provides updates for its phones for only five years or so after their release; users of Android smartphones are lucky to get two. But goods such as washing machines or industrial machinery can have lifespans of a decade or more. Firms will need to work out how to support complicated computerised devices long after their original programmers have moved on.

> 虚拟业务模型将在物理世界中产生冲突。科技公司通常乐于快速行动，打破常规。但你不能发布测试版的冰箱。智能手机制造商苹果(Apple)在其手机发布后，仅用五年左右的时间进行更新;安卓(Android)智能手机的用户很幸运两年左右的时间进行更新。但洗衣机或工业机械等产品的使用寿命可以达到 10 年甚至更长。在最初的程序员离开很久之后，这些公司仍然将需要解决，如何支持复杂的计算机设备。

9Data will be another flashpoint. For much of the internet the business model is to offer “free” services that are paid for with valuable and intimate user data, collected with consent that is half-informed at best. That is true of the iot as well. Smart mattresses track sleep. Medical implants observe and modify heartbeats and insulin levels, with varying degrees of transparency. The insurance industry is experimenting with using data from cars or fitness trackers to adjust customers’ premiums. In the virtual world, arguments about what should be tracked, and who owns the resulting data, can seem airy and theoretical. In the real one, they will feel more urgent.

> 数据将成为另一个引爆点。对于大多数互联网来说，其商业模式是提供“免费”服务，奖励就是使用有价值的、亲密的用户数据，这些数据是在征得用户同意的情况下收集的，最多也只是半知情的。物联网也是如此。智能床垫跟踪睡眠。医用植入物通过不同程度的透明度来观察和调整心跳和胰岛素水平。保险业正在试验使用汽车或健身追踪器的数据来调整客户的保费。在虚拟世界中，关于什么应该被跟踪，以及谁拥有结果数据的争论可能显得空洞而理论化。在现实生活中，他们会感到更紧迫。

10 Then there is competition. Flows of data from IoT gadgets are just as valuable as those gleaned from Facebook posts or a Google search history. The logic of data-driven businesses, which do ever better as they collect and process more information, will replicate the market dynamics that have seen the rise of giant platform companies on the internet. The need for standards, and for IoT devices to talk to each other, will add to the leaders’ advantages—as will consumer fears, some of them justified, over the vulnerability of internet-connected cars, medical implants and other devices to hacking.

> 然后是竞争。来自物联网设备的数据流与从 Facebook 帖子或谷歌搜索历史中收集到的数据流一样有价值。数据驱动企业的逻辑将复制互联网平台巨头崛起时的市场动态。随着他们收集和处理更多的信息，他们做得越来越好。对标准的需求，以及物联网设备之间相互通信的需求，将增加平台巨头们的优势——消费者对联网汽车、医疗植入物和其他设备易受黑客攻击的担忧(其中一些担忧是有道理的)，也将增加平台巨头们的优势。

11 Predicting the consequences of any technology is hard—especially one as universal as computing. The advent of the consumer internet, 25 years ago, was met with starry-eyed optimism. These days it is the internet’s defects, from monopoly power to corporate snooping and online radicalisation, that dominate the headlines. The trick with the IoT, as with anything, will be to maximise the benefits while minimising the harms. That will not be easy. But the people thinking about how to do it have the advantage of having lived through the first internet revolution—which should give them some idea of what to expect.

> 预测任何一项技术的后果都是困难的——尤其是像计算机这样的通用技术。25年前，消费者互联网的出现带来了乐观主义的幻想。如今，占据新闻头条的是互联网的缺陷，从垄断权力到企业窥探和网络激进主义。物联网的技巧就像其他东西一样，是在最大限度地提高效益的同时，将危害降至最低。这并不容易。但是，考虑如何实现这一目标的人具有经历过第一次互联网革命的优势，这应该会让他们对未来有所预期。
