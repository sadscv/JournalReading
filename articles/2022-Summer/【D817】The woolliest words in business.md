# D817 The woolliest words in business
1.Fire-fighting foam starves the flames of oxygen. A handful of overused words have the same **deadening** effect on people’s ability to think. These are words like “innovation”, “collaboration”, “flexibility”, “purpose” and “sustainability”. They coat consultants’ websites, blanket candidates’ cvs and spray from managers’ mouths. They are **anodyne** to the point of being useless.

> **deaden**:消去；减弱
 > 
> **anodyne:**不得罪人的；温和的unlikely to cause disagreement or offend anyone;
 > 

2.These words are **ubiquitous** in part because they are so hard to argue against. Who really wants to be the person making the case for **silo**s? Which executive secretly thirsts to be chief stagnation officer? Is it even possible to have purposelessness as a goal? Just as Karl Popper, a philosopher, made **falsifiability **a test of whether a theory could be described as scientific, **antonymy** is a good way to work out whether an idea has any value. Unless its opposite could possibly have something to recommend it, a word is too woolly to be truly helpful.

> **ubiquitous**:十分普遍的
 > 
> **falsifiability** :可证伪性
 > 
> **antonymy:**反义现象；反义词组
 > 

3.Woolliness is the enemy of accuracy as well as utility. A word like “sustainability” is so fuzzy that it is used to **encompass** everything from a business that thinks sensibly about the long term to the end of capitalism. This column may well count as sustainable because it keeps recycling the same ideas. The lack of precision opens the door to grand-standing and** greenwashing**. Earlier this year Morningstar, a data provider, culled 1,200 funds from its European sustain-able­*investment list after a closer review of their prospectuses and annual reports. Regulators in America and Europe have been scrambling to define standards of sustainability disclosure.

> **encompass:**包含；包围
 > 
> **greenwashing**:漂绿expressions of environmentalist concerns especially as a cover for products, policies, or activities
 > 
> **cull**:部分捕杀
 > 

4.Woolliness also smothers debate about whether you can have too much of a good thing. Take “innovation”, for example. Too much innovation can be a turn­ off for customers. A recent paper from Yingyue Luan and Yeun Joon Kim of the Judge Business School at the University of Cambridge looks at the effect of perceived **novelty** on the response of audiences to films. The researchers find that there is a** sweet spot** in experimentation, where films are distinctive enough to **pique** curiosity but not so **radical** that they **up­end** expectations. In that space between “Home Alone 4” and “Tenet” lie the real moneymaking opportunities.

> **novelty**：新颖；新奇
 > 
> **sweet spot** ：甜蜜点**/**"最佳点"是指能体现出一件事情最好或最有效的地方，通常是球棒或球拍上的一个点。. 它通常是最有生产力的地方
 > 
> **pique：**怨恨；愤恨
 > 
> **radical：**彻底的；完全的；全新的
 > 
> **up­end：**颠覆set or turned on its end or upside down.
 > 

5.Innovation can also be trying for employees. Researchers at the Massachusetts Institute of Technology (mit) recently looked at factors that predicted high levels of **attrition** among companies’ workforces. To their surprise, they found that employees were more likely to leave firms—like Tesla and Nvidia—with high levels of innovation. The authors hypothesise that the long hours and high pressure that **typify** innovative cultures can lead to higher staff** turnover**.

> **attrition**：自然减员；消耗；
 > 
> **typify**：作为…的典型；是…的典范；成为…的特征
 > 
> **turnover：**人事变更率；人员调整率
 > 

6.“Collaboration” is another word that** repay**s closer scrutiny. It can be marvellous: boundaries dissolved, expertise and ideas flowing. But collaboration can also run wild. It often means having more and more people on every **email thread** and in every meeting. It can paralyse decision­making, as everyone and their dog gets to weigh in with their view. (To be fair, the dog often makes the most useful points.)

> **repay: **值得if sth **repays** your attention, interest, study, etc., it is worth spending time to look at it, etc.
 > 

7.And the rewards that flow from collaborativeness are uneven. “The No Club”, a new book by Linda Babcock, Brenda Peyser, Lise Vesterlund and Laurie Weingart, examines the disproportionate amount of “non­promotable work” done by women—tasks like covering absences, organising logistics and mentoring. Collaboration is a much less attractive** proposition** if helping others means spending less time on the sort of work that gets recognised when it is time to hand out actual promotions.

> **proposition:**命题；建议；主张；观点
 > 

8.A host of other woolly words also mask genuine trade­ offs. The supremely** fluffy** notion of “purpose” disguises** hard-­edged** questions of how managers should balance the interests of multiple stake holders. “Flexibility” sounds like a boon to workers, but the reality for employees of coping with last­-minute-changes to schedules is often very different. The mit study found that having a regular schedule was six times more powerful as a predictor of blue-­collar-employee **retention** than having a flexible schedule.

> **retention:** 保留；保持
 > 
> **fluffy：** 浅薄的；无说服力的
 > 
> **hard-­edged: **锋芒毕露的
 > 

9.Traits like innovativeness or collaborativeness are still qualities for firms to aspire to. And this is not an argument for constant qualification of what is meant: the one way to make “purpose” more annoying is to put the word “smart” in front of it. But it is a plea for managers to use woolly words thoughtfully. They are not going away, but they do not have to suffocate mental activity.
