# D370 How to design CEO pay to punish iniquity, not just reward virtue

### Firms are increasingly trying to make badly behaved bosses hand their earnings back

 

1 If business had a Moses, “Thou shalt link pay to performance” would be on his tablet. Compensation committees have, however, tended to stick to a narrow reading of the commandment. Whereas they reward good behaviour, deterring the bad is an afterthought. Worried that this may lead bosses to adopt a mentality of “**heads we win, tails shareholders lose**”, boards are rethinking their priorities—partly in response to pressure from regulators and investors, but also to shifting social winds. Perfectly balanced incentives remain as elusive as the promised land. Still, measures designed to ensure that misconduct does not pay are becoming central to the debate about how to craft bosses’ salary plans.

若商界也有一位摩西，那他的碑文上应有这句话：“ 汝当将功而绩”。不过，报酬委员会对此可能倾向于更狭义地理解。虽然他们对良好表现进行了奖励，防止不当行为却是事后才被想起。鉴于这样做可能会导致企业管理者们采取"正面我们赢，反面股东输"的心态，董事会们正重新思考企业管理者们的优先性——部分原因是回应来自监管机构和投资者的压力，但同样也出于社会风气的转变。完美平衡的激励措施如那应许之地般难寻。尽管如此，旨在确保那些不端行为不会被奖励的措施，正在成为如何制定企业管理者的薪酬计划的讨论中心。

2 The most striking change of recent years has been the rise of the “clawback”. This is a provision in pay plans that gives the board the right (or, less commonly, an obligation) to yank bonuses or stock awards given but later found to be unjustly earned. A prototype, contained in America’s Sarbanes-Oxley reforms of 2002, required retrieving pay from chief executives and chief financial officers whose sins caused **accounting** **restatements**. The idea gained traction after the global financial crisis. The European Union mandated **recouping** money from **wayward** bankers. In America Congress told regulators to craft a new clawback rule. While they **mulled** this, big firms got the message and began to draw up such policies voluntarily. Some 93% of those in the s&p 500 index now say they have one covering cash bonuses, equity awards or both, according to ISS, a proxy-advisory firm, up from a small minority before Sarbanes-Oxley.



近些年来，最显著的改变是“资金追回”措施的兴起。这是一项在薪酬计划中的限制条件，使得董事会有权力（或更少见的是，有义务）去收回那些已给出的，但在后来被发现是不法获得的奖金或股权奖励。2002年美国萨班斯-奥克斯利法案改革涵盖了一项法案原型，它要求追回那些因犯罪而导致发布会计更正报告的CEO和CFO们的报酬。这个想法在全球金融危机之后变得越来越受欢迎。欧盟被授予权利以收回不遵守原则的银行家的钱。在美国，国会要求监管机构起草一项新的追回资金规定。当政府还在酝酿这些时，大企业得到讯号，也开始自发地起草相关政策。据代理投票机构ISS所述，在萨班斯法案推出之前仅有很少一部分标普500公司有或是涉及现金奖励，或是涉及股权激励的，或是二者兼具的相关政策，而如今这比例在标普500公司中升至约93%。

3 As such provisions have grown in popularity, two things have happened. First, the list of misdeeds covered has lengthened. What initially applied solely to criminal financial conduct now extends to almost anything that might damage a firm’s reputation. That includes creating a toxic corporate culture, sexual harassment and “inappropriate” personal relationships; cupping backsides is taken as seriously as cooking books.

 

cook books: 作假账

**Cupping someone's backside** means **holding one or both of someone's buttocks in the curved hand or hands**. It is one example of casual sexual touching, that is assault if unwanted, that can happen in the workplace or elsewhere.

4 The second development is that more firms—albeit still a minority—are plucking up the courage to invoke the provisions. Wells Fargo clawed back $28m from John Stumpf on top of the $41m he forfeited when he resigned as ceo of the lender in 2016, after a probe concluded he had engendered a culture that encouraged employees to open fake accounts to lift sales. Goldman Sachs tapped a dozen current and former executives for $175m last year to help ease the pain of whopping fines over the investment bank’s role in the 1mdb embezzlement scandal. McDonald’s is trying to recoup $57m of **severance** pay from its ex-boss, Steve Easterbrook, who was fired over sexual relationships with underlings.

 

V-T及物动词If you **forfeit** something, you lose it or are forced to give it up because you have broken a rule or done something wrong. (因违规或做错事而) 失去; 被迫放弃

**Severance** pay is a sum of money that a company gives to its employees when it has to stop employing them. 离职的 (补偿金)

 

1MDB: 1Malaysia Development Berhad scandal一个马来西亚发展有限公司丑闻， 简称“一马公司丑闻”，是指一宗非法盗用一马公司大笔资金和牵涉国家政治的贪污丑闻。这宗丑闻也是导致马来西亚政权交替的一个主要因素。 2015年，马来西亚总理纳吉布遭反对党指控，将马来西亚政府管辖的一马公司资金转入他的个人银行户口，涉及金额超过26.7亿林吉特。

 

5 The Goldman Sachs case encapsulates the pros and cons of clawbacks. The firm won **plaudits** for its stance; here was a Wall Street giant willing to make **top brass** pick up some of the tab for wrongdoing. But what initially seemed a bold move became an embarrassment when Gary Cohn, its former second-in-command, who had **cashed in** his pay awards on joining the Trump administration in 2016, **demurred**. The stand-off ended when Mr Cohn agreed to pay a sum, reportedly $10m, to charity. Much as the bank tried to **spin** this as fair, it was made to look impotent.

 

If a person or a thing receives **plaudits** from a group of people, those people express their admiration for or approval of that person or thing. 喝彩; 赞扬

In the army or in other organizations, **the** **top brass** are the people in the highest positions. 要员

PHRASE[非正式]习语If you **pick up the tab**, you pay a bill on behalf of a group of people or provide the money that is needed for something. (代表一群人) 付帐; 承担全部费用

**cashed in ：**兑现

If you **demur**, you say that you do not agree with something or will not do something that you have been asked to do. 表示异议

In politics, **spin** is the way in which political parties try to present everything they do in a positive way to the public and the media. (政治) 粉饰

 

6 The episode underlines that, when it comes to compensation, he who has already **paid the piper** finds it harder to **call the tune**. Goldman Sachs’s board could have **shown more spine** and seen Mr Cohn in court, if only to signal it was serious about **holding grandees to account**. That, though, would have been costly and risky. Lawyers’ fees might have exceeded what Mr Cohn owed as they **wrangled** over what is “excessive” pay, “inappropriate” behaviour or “inadequate” oversight in a scandal that involved decisions at many levels. 

 

If you say 'He who **pays the piper**' or 'He who **pays the piper calls the tune**', you mean that the person who provides the money for something decides what will be done, or has a right to decide what will be done.　谁出钱，谁说了算。

When you tell **some** one to **show some spine** or **show some backbone**, you are telling them to be brave or morally strong. If someone has no **backbone** or is spineless, it means they are a coward 表现得更勇敢、强硬

**hold someone to account:** to require a person to explain tor to accept responsibility for his or her actions, to blame or punish

If you say that someone **is wrangling** **with** someone **over** a question or issue, you mean that they have been arguing angrily for a long time about it. (长时间的) 争吵

 

7 The court might have sided with Mr Cohn, who was never personally accused of wrongdoing. Boards must also consider potential bad publicity. McDonald’s was put **on the back foot** when Mr Easterbrook claimed it already had information about his liaisons, including sexually explicit emails, when it approved his severance package.

**on the back foot :**处于不利境地

 

8 Unsurprisingly, then, some firms try to just put the mess behind them. GE decided last month not to claw back pay from an ex-boss, Jeff Immelt, after a huge write-off and a probe into disclosure policies led to a $200m fine for the industrial conglomerate. (He denies wrongdoing.) Drugmakers accused of stoking the opioid epidemic have also eschewed clawbacks. Such clauses may deter some executives from reporting misconduct. And broadening what is considered wrongdoing creates ambiguity. Some firms include behaviour “embarrassing” to them. Might a ceo expressing **exotic** political views count?

 

N-COUNT可数名词A **write-off** is something, such as a living expense, that can be deducted from your taxes. 从税中扣除的费用

Something that is **exotic** is unusual and interesting, usually because it comes from or is related to a distant country. (常因来自遥远的他国而显得) 奇异的

 

**9 Fire, brimstone and bonuses**

 

**Fire and brimstone** is an idiomatic expression referring to God's wrath found in both the Hebrew Bible and the Christian New Testament. In the Bible, it often appears in reference to the fate of the unfaithful.

 

Still, deterrence efforts are proliferating. One popular policy is to lengthen deferral periods for pay, by a year or more for cash bonuses, and a similar period beyond the vesting date for equity grants—in some cases until after the executive leaves the firm. Though less dramatic than clawbacks, this has the advantage of reducing the chance that the money has left the company before alleged misbehaviour emerges. Last month cvs Health, other pharmacy chains and even a few drugmakers (like Bristol Myers Squibb), agreed on a set of extended-deferral principles with a group of investors who had threatened to agitate over the firms’ role in the opioid crisis.

 

**Brimstone** is the same as . 硫黄

PHRASE[文学性]习语When people talk about **fire and brimstone**, they are referring to hell and how they think people are punished there after death. 地狱之火

 

10 Clawbacks, too, will spread. For one thing, the pandemic recession has **stoked** anger over excessive executive pay—particularly perceived pay-for-failure such as Boeing’s $62m payoff to Dennis Muilenburg, who presided over the **bungled** response to two crashes of its 737 max passenger jets. And big investors like such provisions. In just a few years BlackRock, the world’s biggest asset manager, has gone from **tepid** to wholehearted support for them. What better way to focus executives’ minds than to make it clear that what the board giveth, the board can take away? 

 

**stoke：**encourage or incite (a strong emotion or tendency)

e.g. "his composure had the effect of stoking her anger"

If you **bungle** something, you fail to do it properly, because you make mistakes or are clumsy. 搞砸

Water or another liquid that is **tepid** is slightly warm. 微温的
