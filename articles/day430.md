## This is unlikely to help children diagnosed with gender dysphoria

1 As transgender medicine has boomed in America, the number of doctors offering puberty blockers and cross-sex hormones to children who identify as the opposite sex has surged. In some states the World Professional Association for Transgender Health lists more than a dozen **endocrinologists** who work with children. In Arkansas it lists just one. Yet this month the state became the first to ban the prescription of such drugs to those aged under 18. Unless the American Civil Liberties Union (aclu), which has become a vocal champion of trans rights, succeeds in blocking the law, the Save Adolescents from Experimentation (safe) Act will come into effect this summer.

> **Puberty** is the stage in someone's life when their body starts to become physically mature. 青春期

> **Endocrinologists:** 内分泌学家



2 Arkansas is one of more than 16 states to have introduced such a bill in recent months, according to the aclu. An even greater number have introduced legislation that would prevent transgender girls from playing on female sports teams (Arkansas passed such a law in March). Lawmakers in these mostly conservative states are pushing back against the Biden administration’s embrace of gender ideology, which holds that trans people should be recognised as the sex with which they identify (meaning trans women should have access to women-only spaces, from prisons to hospital **wards**) and that trans-identifying children should have access to puberty blockers and cross-sex hormones.

> A **ward** is a room in a hospital which has beds for many people, often people who need similar treatment. 病房



3 For lawmakers to impose a blanket ban on the use of such drugs in children is a mistake, argued Arkansas’s Republican governor, Asa Hutchinson, when he vetoed the law (the House and Senate overrode his veto). It created, he said, “new standards of legislative interference with **physicians** and parents as they deal with some of the most complex and sensitive matters involving young people”. He also described the law as a product of America’s culture wars. His point was exemplified by lawmakers’ **hyperbolic** claims that young children in the state are undergoing sex-change surgery (they are not). Doctors, meanwhile, worry about the law’s wider **ramifications**. Dr Janet Cathey, a co-founder of the state’s first transgender clinic at the University of Arkansas for Medical Sciences, says she worries it will deter young doctors in other medical fields from wanting to work in Arkansas.

> You use **blanket** to describe something when you want to emphasize that it affects or refers to every person or thing in a group, without any exceptions. 适用于全体的

> A **physician** is a medical doctor. 内科医生

> If you describe language as **hyperbolic**, you mean that it makes something sound much more impressive than it really is. 运用夸张法的; 夸张的

> The **ramifications** of a decision, plan, or event are all its consequences and effects, especially ones that are not obvious at first. (尤指最初并不明显的) 后果



4 Yet the bills are not only political opportunism. They are also a response to mounting concerns about the use of puberty blockers and cross-sex hormones in children. Blockers, which are **prescribed** from around the age of nine to children who feel desperate about developing secondary characteristics of their sex, like breasts and facial hair, are not licensed for this purpose, nor have they undergone a clinical trial for it. Research shows they cause bone damage and may affect brain development.

> Blocker: a substance that prevents or inhibits a given physiological function

> **prescribe**:(of a medical practitioner) advise and authorize the use of (a medicine or treatment) for someone, especially in writing.



5 Doctors who treat trans-identifying children say blockers buy time while patients work out whether to proceed to cross-sex hormones. Yet the vast majority of children on blockers go on to hormones, suggesting the drugs operate more as a push than a pause. Cross-sex hormones, meanwhile, cause **myriad** severe health problems, including **uterine** **atrophy** and heart problems for trans men on testosterone. They can cause **sterility**.

> **Myriad** means having a large number or great variety. 大量的; 各种各样的

> **Uterine** means relating to the uterus of a woman or female mammal. 有关子宫的

> If a muscle or other part of the body **atrophies**, it decreases in size or strength, often as a result of an illness. (肌肉或身体其他部分)萎缩

> **sterility：.**[泌尿] 不育；[妇产] 不孕；无菌；不毛；内容贫乏



6 All this is prompting other countries to introduce curbs on the use of blockers. Last year, British judges ruled that children were unlikely to be able to give meaningful consent to taking them. Their review was sparked by the case of a young woman, Keira Bell, who took blockers and hormones as a teenager (and at 20 had her breasts cut off) before realising that she was a lesbian woman, not a trans man.



7 America, where health care is more profit-driven and decentralised than in most rich countries, seems a long way from even a discussion of the need for such limits. Instead, the focus is on affirming the desire for [medical transition](https://gender.wikia.org/wiki/Medical_Transition). Some [states ](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/List_of_U.S._jurisdictions_banning_conversion_therapy)have passed laws banning “conversion therapy”, a term misused to describe therapy that explores causes of gender dysphoria other than trans-ness. Professional bodies, like the American Academy of Paediatrics, have endorsed **[affirmative care](https://focus.psychiatryonline.org/doi/10.1176/appi.focus.20190030)** and puberty blockers. Some of its members believe this is a mistake, but fear they will lose their jobs if they say so publicly.

> **Affirmative care** is **defined** as an approach to health **care** delivery in which organizations, programs, and providers recognize, validate, and support the identity stated or expressed by the individuals served 



8 The view routinely expressed in America is rather that puberty blockers “save lives” (an allusion to the belief that trans children are at a greatly heightened risk of suicide; there is no evidence for this). Health-care professionals who work with trans children **extol** the wonders of blockers and hormones. When asked about worries that these drugs are being prescribed without first properly exploring other **[comorbidities](https://www.britannica.com/science/comorbidity)**[ ](https://www.britannica.com/science/comorbidity)common in trans-identifying youngsters—like depression and **anorexia**—Elizabeth Stout, a psychologist in Little Rock, Arkansas, suggested that blockers and hormones could sometimes function as a cure-all. “It is often the case that treating the gender dysphoria first eliminates the need to treat the other mental-health concern at all,” she said. ■
