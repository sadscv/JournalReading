## In “Coffeeland”, Augustine Sedgewick focuses on a single plantation in El Salvador



1 What began as an obscure berry from the highlands of Ethiopia is now, five centuries later, a ubiquitous global necessity. Coffee has changed the world along the way. A “wakeful and civil drink”, its pep as a stimulant awoke Europe from an alcoholic **stupor** and “improved useful knowledge very much”, as a 17th-century observer put it, helping fuel the ensuing scientific and financial revolutions. Coffeehouses, an idea that travelled with the **refreshment** from the Arab world, became information exchanges and centres of collaboration; coffee remains the default drink of personal networking to this day.

> Someone who is **in** a **stupor** is almost unconscious and is unable to act or think normally, especially as a result of drink or drugs. (尤指由于醉酒或吸毒导致的)神志不清; 不省人事
>
> **Refreshments** are drinks and small amounts of food that are provided, for example, during a meeting or a trip. 茶点/食物和饮料
>
> 起初它是生长于埃塞俄比亚高原上一种鲜为人知的浆果，五个世纪后，却已然成为全球无处不在的必需品。在此进程中，咖啡改变了世界。咖啡是一种 "唤人清醒和平民化的饮料"，它的提神功能使其作为兴奋剂将欧洲从酒精的恍惚和麻木中唤醒，并且，正如一位17世纪的观察家所说的那样，作为兴奋剂的咖啡也"极大地帮助增加了有用的知识"；它为随后到来的科学和金融革命推波助澜。咖啡馆，这个从阿拉伯世界传来的让人焕然一新的概念，成为了信息交流和合作的中心；直到今天，咖啡仍是个人社交中的默认饮品。

2 The focus of Augustine Sedgewick’s book is not coffee’s effect on drinkers but its role in the story of global capitalism, as a commodity that links producers in poor countries with consumers in rich ones. Coffee does more than merely reflect this divide, he argues—it has played a central role in shaping it. It is, he notes, “the commodity we use more than any other to think about how the world economy works and what to do about it”.

> 奥古斯丁·塞吉威克撰写这本书的重点不是咖啡对其饮用者的影响，而是咖啡在全球资本主义发展的过程中所扮演的角色。在此进程中，它作为一种将贫穷国家的生产者与富裕国家的消费者联系在一起的商品。奥古斯丁·塞吉威克认为，咖啡不仅反映出这种贫富国家之间的鸿沟，它甚至在塑造这种鸿沟方面也发挥了核心作用。他指出：“咖啡是我们使用最多的去思考世界经济如何运行以及如何应对世界经济变化的商品。”

3 To illuminate this history, and the web of connections between workers on plantations and coffee-sipping consumers, Mr Sedgewick focuses on a single planter in one country: James Hill, a British emigrant who by the 1920s had established himself as “the coffee king of El Salvador”. By telling the story of El Salvador’s emergence as the world’s most intensive coffee economy, and following coffee beans from Hill’s plantation to American consumers’ cups, Mr Sedgewick **painstakingly** shows how shifts in the global coffee market have affected conditions for workers on the ground. The result is a portrait of the political and economic consequences of the world’s addiction to coffee.

> **painstakingly:** 煞费苦心地；费力地
>
> 为了说明这段历史，以及种植园工人和咖啡消费者之间的联系，塞吉威克先生将重点放在萨尔瓦多的一位种植者詹姆斯-希尔身上。作为一名英国移民，20世纪20年代时，詹姆斯就已经自称为 "萨尔瓦多的咖啡大王"了。通过讲述萨尔瓦作为世界上最密集的咖啡经济体诞生的故事，和跟随从希尔的种植园到美国消费者的杯中的咖啡豆，塞奇维克先生苦心孤诣地展示了全球咖啡市场的变化对当地工人的条件产生了怎样的影响。结果表明，它是世界对咖啡的痴迷所带来的政治和经济后果的描绘。

4 He **tucks** many fascinating details into his narrative. Contrary to popular belief, for example, it was not the Boston Tea Party that led to tea’s **dethronement** **as** America’s favourite hot drink: it was the abolition of tariffs on coffee imports in the early 19th century, as the United States sought to build trade ties and buy influence across Latin America. Imports doubled every decade between 1800 and 1850; during the civil war the average Union soldier consumed five cups of coffee a day. By the turn of the 20th century consumption per person in America was roughly double the level in France and ten times that in Italy. Most of this coffee came from Latin America.

> If you **tuck** something somewhere, you put it there so that it is safe, comfortable, or neat. (为舒服或整齐) 把…塞入; 把…夹入
>
> 他在叙述中加入了许多吸引人的细节。例如，与普遍观点不同，他认为不是波士顿倾茶事件，而是19世纪初"美国试图通过建立贸易关系以在拉丁美洲扩大影响力"而取消咖啡进口关税才是导致茶叶没能继续成为美国人最喜欢热饮的原因。从1800年到1850年，美国咖啡进口量每十年翻一番；内战期间，联邦士兵平均每天要喝五杯咖啡。到了20世纪之交，美国人均咖啡消费量大约是法国的两倍，是意大利的十倍。而这些咖啡大部分来自于拉丁美洲。

5 A secondary theme is the relationship between food and labour, and the effort to measure human food consumption and energy output. Hill applied ideas from industrial Manchester, the city of his birth, to **wring** as much work as possible from his team. By paying mostly in food, and removing all other sources of it (such as wild fruit trees), he could manipulate the degree of hunger among local workers, and thus the availability of labour. The resulting coffee was then used to optimise the efficiency of workers in America, as bosses realised that formal coffee breaks improved productivity. Both coffee producers and consumers, Mr Sedgewick **scathingly** implies, are mere **cogs** in the **remorse**less machinery of global capitalism.

> If you **wring** something **out of** someone, you manage to make them give it to you even though they do not want to. 设法获取
>
> If you say that someone is being **scathing** about something, you mean that they are being very critical of it. 尖锐的; 刻薄的
>
> If you describe someone as **a cog in a machine** or **wheel**, you mean that they are a small part of a large organization or group. (大型机构或组织中的)小人物  **cog**：齿轮
>
> **Remorse** is a strong feeling of sadness and regret about something wrong that you have done. 懊悔; 悔恨; 自责
>
> 在本书中，次要主题是讲食物与劳工之间的关系，以及为衡量人类食物消耗和能源输出关系所做的努力。希尔沿用了他的出生地工业城市曼彻斯特的思路，尽可能多地从他的团队中榨取劳动。通过主要以食物支付劳动报酬，并消除所有其他食物的来源（如野生果树），他可以控制当地工作者的饥饿程度，从而控制劳动力的供用。这样生产出来的咖啡继而在美国被用来优化工作者的效率，因为老板们意识到正式的咖啡休息时间可以提高生产力。塞吉威克先生不留情面地暗示，咖啡的生产者和消费者都不过是全球资本主义这一无情机器中的齿轮罢了。

6 After all this readers might expect his conclusion to be a **ringing** endorsement of the “fair trade” model (coffee is by far the leading fair-trade product), which adds a small premium to the price of certified coffees to fund projects to improve workers’ welfare. In fact, Mr Sedgewick thinks the arguments over fair trade obscure a more fundamental issue, which is the lack of other opportunities in places where the local economy is dominated by coffee. In El Salvador’s “dictatorship of coffee”, where coffee planters enjoyed a virtual monopoly on politics, the only alternatives were migration or revolution, leading to decades of **strife** during the 20th century that **pitted** coffee growers **against** their overlords.

> A **ringing** statement or declaration is one that is made forcefully and is intended to make a powerful impression. (声明、宣言等) 强有力的
>
> **Strife** is strong disagreement or fighting. 冲突
>
> **Pit against** definition is - to cause (someone or something) to fight or compete against (another person or thing). 
>
> 读完这些章节，读者可能会以为他的结论是对 "公平贸易 "模式（咖啡是目前最主要的公平贸易产品）的认可，例如为认证咖啡增加小额溢价用以改善工人福利。事实上，塞吉威克先生认为，关于公平贸易的争论掩盖了一个更根本的问题，那就是，在那些本地经济被咖啡主导的地方缺少其他方面的机会。在萨尔瓦多的 "咖啡专政 "中，咖啡种植园主实际上享有政治上的垄断地位，而人民唯一的选择就是移民或这革命。这导致了在20世纪长达几十年的冲突，使得咖啡种植工人与他们的园主愈加对立。

7 Artfully blending together all these strands, and **juggling** a wide cast of characters, Mr Sedgewick’s book is a parable of how a commodity can link producers, consumers, markets and politics in unexpected ways. Like the drink it describes, it is an eye-opening, stimulating brew.

> If you **juggle** lots of different things, such as your work and your family, you try to give enough time or attention to all of them. 尽量兼顾
>
> 塞吉威克先生的书如同寓言故事一样将不同的故事线巧妙地糅合在一起，同时勾勒出大量的人物角色，将一种商品如何以意想不到的方式把生产者、消费者、市场和政治联系在一起。这本书就像其描写的咖啡那样，大开眼界且令人深省。
