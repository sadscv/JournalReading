# DAY 39 It’s official: coronavirus puts off the Tokyo Olympics

1 “THE PREPARATIONS for the games are, as we have repeatedly stated, making rapid progress,” promised an official from the Japanese Olympic Committee, even as the crisis deepened. Despite mounting doubts from athletes and sporting , the president of the International Olympic Committee (IOC) would not contemplate a delay: “The Tokyo games will and must go on.” Such were the vows made in 1938 by the organisers of the 1940 Olympics—which never took place. Japan was trying to reassure the public that the “China Incident”, ie, its invasion of its gigantic neighbour, and China’s continued resistance, would not hurt its ability to host the Olympics. It eventually had to cancel the event later that year. Japan was delusional then because it was a military dictatorship, bent on subjugating Asia, heedless to the huge casualties it was causing. These days, it is a model global citizen. But, for the second time, Tokyo faces having an Olympics derailed—on this occasion, by the covid-19 pandemic.

> 日本奥委会(Japanese Olympic Committee)的一名官员承诺:“正如我们一再声明的那样，奥运会的筹备工作正在迅速取得进展。”虽然危机仍在加深。尽管运动员和体育联合会的质疑越来越多，国际奥委会的总统不会考虑推迟:“东京奥运会将会而且必须继续下去。这是1940年奥运会组织者在1938年许下的誓言，而这届奥运会从未举办过。日本试图向公众保证，“中国事件”，即日本对其庞大邻国的入侵，以及中国的持续抵抗，不会妨碍日本举办奥运会的能力。最终不得不在当年晚些时候取消了这一活动。当时的日本十分妄自尊大，因为它是一个军事独裁国家，一心想要征服亚洲，哪怕造成了自己巨大的伤亡。如今，它是一个模范的全球公民。但是，东京再一次面临奥运会脱轨的危险——这次是由于新冠病毒大流行。

2 As happened eight decades ago, the Japanese authorities and the IOC kept insisting, long after everyone else stopped believing them, that all was going to plan. On March 17th the IOC said there was “no need for any drastic decisions at this stage”, and that it was “fully committed” to holding the Olympics in July, even as betting markets gave that outcome a 15% probability. On March 20th the Olympic flame duly arrived in Japan from Greece. **But after that things unravelled quickly.** Three days later Australia and Canada announced they would not send teams to an Olympics held in Tokyo in July and June August. Britain, France and America urged the IOC to reach a decision quickly.

> 正如80年前所发生的那样，在其他人都不再相信他们之后的很长一段时间，日本当局和国际奥委会仍然坚持认为，一切都是需要按计划进行。 3月17日，国际奥委会表示，“目前这个阶段没有必要做出任何激烈的决定”，它“完全赞同”在7月份举行奥运会，尽管博彩市场对这种结果只给出了15%的可能性。 3月20日，奥运圣火正式从希腊抵达日本。 但在那之后事情很快就会明朗了。 三天后，澳大利亚和加拿大宣布不会派队参加7月和8月在东京举行的奥运会。 英国、法国和美国敦促国际奥委会迅速做出决定。

> 3. The same day, the Athletics Association, a union for track-and-field competitors, published a poll of more than 4,000 members, 87% of whom said that the pandemic had adversely affected their preparations. The disruption has been serious enough for 78% to prefer a postponement (see chart). Moreover, several sports stars complained that they were having to risk their safety in order，一些运动明星抱怨到他们为了保持健康冒着生命风险。国际田联—一个田径运动的管理机构，认为七月份的赛事“既不可行也不可取”，因为病毒传播的不均衡对一些国家代表队的阻碍大于另外一些国家代表队。（有一些国家受疫情影响较小，这个国家队可能在奥运会上面的优势大于那些受疫情较大的国家）

4 On March 24th Japan and the IOC bowed to the inevitable. Abe Shinzo, Japan’s prime minister, told reporters that he and Thomas Bach, the IOC’s president, were in “100% agreement” about postponing the games. A joint statement from the IOC and the Tokyo organising committee said they would be rescheduled to next year, but not later than the summer, in order “to safeguard the health of the athletes, everybody involved in the Olympic games and the international community”.

> 3月24日，日本和国际奥委会向不可避免的结果低头。 日本首相安倍晋三告诉记者，他和国际奥委会主席托马斯·巴赫就推迟奥运会达成了“100%的一致”。 国际奥委会(IOC)和东京奥组委(Tokyo organizing committee)在一份联合声明中表示，它们将重新安排在明年，但不会晚于今年夏季，以“保障运动员、参与奥运会的所有人以及国际社会的健康”。

5 Another reason for delay came with a recent spike in covid-19 infections in Tokyo. Japan seemed to have successfully contained the virus, with only 14 deaths in the past seven days, but on March 23rd Koike Yuriko,Tokyo’s governor, expressed alarm about a surge in new cases and warned that Tokyo might have to impose a lockdown. This followed a long holiday weekend in which many crowds had ignored social-distancing guidelines to enjoy the annual tradition of collective cherry-blossom viewing in Tokyo’s parks.

6 For Mr Abe, postponement of the games is a personal embarrassment, in light of his long refusal to countenance a delay to what has become a legacy project for him. The games were intended to mark the country’s definitive recovery not just from the devastation of the earthquake-tsunami-nuclear disaster of 2011, but more broadly from the gloom of the country’s post-1980s inertia. Postponement, however, also represents a partial victory for Mr Abe. The alternative, after all, was cancellation. He is reported to have won the consent of other G7 leaders in a teleconference last week. He apparently still hopes to freight the games with weighty historic symbolism: of the world’s triumph over coronavirus.

> 对于安倍晋三而言，推迟奥运会是他个人的尴尬局面，因为他一直拒绝表态推迟，对于他来说已经是他个人的遗留事项了。奥运会的举办标志这个国家最终的复苏，不仅是因为2011年的地震，海啸或者是核灾难，更多的是因为这个国家从1980年后惯性的阴霾。不管怎么说，延期对于安倍晋三来说，也代表了他的部分胜利。毕竟，替代被取消了。据报道，在上周的远程电话会议上他赢得了其他7个集团领导的同意。显然，他仍希望以沉重的历史象征来推动奥运会：对于世界在冠状病毒的胜利。

7 The long indecision, however, was also about money. Behind the scenes, the IOC and Tokyo began negotiating some time ago about how to divide the cost of a postponement, suspects John Mehrzad, a sports lawyer at Littleton Chambers in London. He notes that the two organising bodies have a “huge number of contracts and liabilities to consider” and have been consulting the relevant partners for several weeks. The IOC and Tokyo have insurance policies for the games, but both are reported to cover less than $1bn.

> 这么长时间的犹豫不决，主要是由于钱的问题。一个运动方面的伦敦私人律师说，这样的的情景下，奥委会和东京方面早些时间已经开始协商奥运会延期的成本。他提到，两大主办方会有大量的合同债务需要处理，而且已经跟相关合作伙伴洽谈几周了。奥委会和东京都为这次赛事投了保险，但据说两方的投保金额都少于十亿美金。

8 In contrast, the games will cost an estimated $25bn in all, nearly four times the original budget. Broadcasters, who paid around $4bn for the previous four-year Olympic cycle, will have handed over much more this time, and now have empty schedules in July. Sponsors for the 2020 games have already **forked out** more than $3bn to have their brands shown to the world. At least one-sixth of the 5,600 apartments in the athletes’ village have been sold, leaving buyers without houses for another year.

> 相比之下，这个运动会预计总共会花费250亿，这几乎是初始预算的4倍。广播集团，已经为之前的四年奥运周期中支付了差不多40亿，而这一次他们将支付更多的费用，而且他们七月份的计划表已经空了。赞助商为了能在2020年的奥运会上向世界展示他们的品牌已经有超过30亿的花销。奥运村5600套公寓中，至少有六分之一已经被卖掉了，而买家要再没有房子一年。

9 The organisers are likely to face litigation over the delay, says Mr Mehrzad. But at least the games, when they happen, will enable them to generate income to recoup some of the investment. Even though it may be many years before the full financial cost of the postponement becomes clear, it will be cheaper, it is hoped, than cancellation. And a short delay would be something of a silver lining for Japanese residents. The previous time, they had to wait until 1964 for a home Olympics—an interlude of 24 years. And, whenever they happen, says Ms Koike, these games will always be known as the “2020 Olympics”. Not that this year is one likely to provoke nostalgia.

> xx说到，组织者由于这次延期很可能面临诉讼。当这种情况发生时，起码这场赛事会刺激经济，收回部分投资。正如人们所希冀的，尽管还需要很长一段时间因延期产生的所有经济费用才会日渐明朗，这也比取消更便宜。对于日本居民来说，短暂的延期也可能是一线希望。直到上一次1964年日本主办国内奥运会，已经等了24年的时间了。xx说到，不管什么时候举办，这些赛事会一直被称作2020奥运会，可这并不意味着今年是激起怀旧情绪的一年。
