# DAY 47 The power of newspaper cartoons during a public health crisis
1 ON JANUARY 27th Jyllands-Posten, a Danish newspaper, printed a cartoon of the Chinese flag, with yellow SARS-COV-2 virus particles instead of the stars. At the time, the coronavirus outbreak was almost entirely limited to China, which had recorded 4,349 confirmed cases and 106 deaths. More than 44,000 people were under quarantine in the city of Wuhan, where the disease is thought to have originated, and the surrounding province of Hubei.

2 China’s embassy in Denmark immediately demanded that the paper issue an apology, claiming that the drawing lacked “sympathy or empathy”. Jyllands-Posten refused, saying that it was not demeaning the Chinese people; Danish politicians defended the paper’s freedom of speech. Other Western newspapers, lambasted by Chinese authorities for their coverage of the coronavirus pandemic, have been quick to argue that their critiques are directed at the Chinese state, which initially suppressed information about the disease, rather than at its citizens. (Jyllands-Posten has a history of controversial cartoons. It sparked protests over its depiction of the Prophet Muhammad as a terrorist in 2005—other newspapers which reprinted the images, including Charlie Hebdo in France, subsequently came under verbal and physical attack.)

3 In depicting disease, cartoonists face a particular challenge: how do you render something as imperceptible as a virus in a single frame, where there is little room for **nuance** or context? Before the disease took hold outside China, many resorted to images that referred to the pestilence’s point of origin, real or perceived. A cover of The Economist in February had the globe wearing a face mask emblazoned with a Chinese flag. Some artists incorporated racial elements as a form of visual shorthand. **This month a cartoonist for the** **Sydney Morning Herald showed an angry figure in a hazmat suit towering over an unwell Asian man.**

4 Such scribblings have had destructive consequences in the past. In 1894 southern China was beset by an outbreak of bubonic plague; six years later, it had reached every continent via international shipping routes. In 1900 several newspapers in California ran cartoons depicting Chinese-Americans living in crowded, dirty spaces, or eating rats. This perpetuated the idea that Chinese-Americans were a threat to public health—even if they had no contact with China—which subsequently influenced state action, including the lockdown of Chinatowns in American cities. (In Honolulu, authorities began incinerating refuse within the quarantine zone, leading to a fire that destroyed as many as 4,000 homes.)

5 During the SARS outbreak in 2003 several North American newspapers ran cartoons which **stigmatised** Chinese people. The Tribune Review in Pittsburgh, for example, showed a steaming Chinese takeaway container labelled “SARS” with the caption: “BAD CHINESE TAKE OUT”. Anti-Asian sentiment was common, and people and businesses of Asian origin were frequently ostracised. Similarly, many Asian people have spoken about the racism they have experienced in the wake of the covid-19 epidemic: violence against Asian-Americans has spiked in the last month, according to Asian Americans Advancing Justice, an activist group based in Washington. Some of the blame for that lies at the feet of President Donald Trump, who has continued to refer to the coronavirus as the “Chinese virus”, but it is unlikely to have been helped by the circulation of denigrating images, such as a drawing by Monte Wolverton, an American cartoonist, showing a mass of tentacles erupting from China and captioned “YET ANOTHER PANDEMIC”. The image was syndicated to seveal news sites in the United States and elsewhere.

> 6 Yet the tone of most editorial cartoons in the West is changing as the virus spreads. Daryl Cagle, who runs a site syndicating cartoons （联合漫画网站）from around the world, told the Washington Post that “there were more China clichés（陈腔滥调） in the early days of the pandemic”. Recent cartoons have instead mocked the missteps of domestic leaders, portrayed the volatile stockmarket or focused on the absurdities（谬论，荒谬行为） of the new reality readers find themselves living in. A riff on Michaelangelo’s painting “The Creation of Adam” in the Greek newspaper Efimerida ton Syntakton showed God and a masked Adam reaching their elbows tentatively towards one another.

> Several artists have sought to highlight the labours and sacrifice of health workers in the face of the pandemic. Mike Luckovich, a Pulitzer-prizewinning（普利策获奖者） cartoonist for the Atlanta Journal-Constitution, reimagined the famous image of United States Marines raising the flag on Iwo Jima（硫磺岛）, with the soldiers replaced by nurses, doctors and scientists. Rather than **pitting** groups against each other, such images emphasise common humanity and decency.

7 Cartoons have many strengths: they are quick to make and publish, easily consumed and shareable. In times of crisis, the best cartoonists offer a moment of levity or encourage solidarity rather than sowing division. An **apposite** and moving example came from Graeme Bandeira at the Yorkshire Post earlier this month. The black-and-white drawing shows an old lady, limping empty-handed down a **denuded** shopping aisle. The caption reads simply: “Be Kind.”
