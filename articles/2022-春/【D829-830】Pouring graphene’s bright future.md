# # D829-830 Pouring graphene’s bright future
### **A wonder material that promised much but delivered little may at last have found its killer app **
1.Close to where the college **rowing team**s of Britain’s second­-oldest university practise their strokes along the River Cam, a grey shipping container sits outside a business unit waiting to be dispatched to **Abu Dhabi**. Inside is a piece of equipment devised by a firm called Levidian Nanosystems. In a deal announced on May 16th with Zero Carbon Ventures, a firm in the United Arab Emirates, Levidian will ship 500 more such units to the region over the next five years. They will take **methane** emitted from** landfill** or being **flared off** at oil­-production sites, and turn it into cleaner-­burning hydrogen, along with a pile of fluffy black powder called graphene.

2.Graphene, which consists of **monolayer**s of carbon atoms bonded in a repeating hexagonal pattern, is the thinnest known material. It was isolated in 2004 at the University of Manchester by Andre Geim and Konstantin Novoselov, who went on to win a Nobel prize for their discovery.

3.At the time, amid much **hype**, graphene was said to offer astonishing possibilities. It certainly has many interesting properties. For a start, it is 200 times stronger than steel. Yet it is extremely lightweight and flexible. It is also an excellent conductor of heat and electricity, and exhibits interesting light­-absorbing abilities. Researchers are still finding ways to tune it to obtain other features. Recently, for example, it has been shown that by arranging several sheets of graphene at particular angles, a **super-conducting** version of the material (that is, one which lets electricity pass without resistance) can be created.

4.Yet despite this promise, apart from a few** niche **uses in electronics, water filtration and some specialist sports equipment, graphene remains largely unemployed. Certainly, no killer application of the sort predicted when the stuff was discovered has emerged. But that could be about to change. Concrete is as far from **super-conductivity **on the technological sexiness **spectrum** as it is possible to get. Yet it is an important material and of great concern to those attempting to slow down global warming, because the process of making it inevitably releases carbon dioxide. And graphene may hold the key to reducing that contribution considerably.

5.Concrete is made by mixing sand, **gravel**, water and cement. And cement is made by **roasting** **limestone**, a rock composed of calcium carbonate, to drive off carbon dioxide and leave behind calcium oxide. The 5bn tonnes of cement produced each year thus account for some 8% of the world’s **anthropogenic **CO2, and generate abnormally high emissions per dollar of revenue earned compared even with other polluting industries (see chart on next page). Yet if less than 0.1% by weight of graphene is added to the mixture, concrete ends up 30% stronger. And stronger concrete means less of it is needed, with a consequent reduction in CO2.

6.That does, indeed, sound like a killer app. There is, though, some way to go. As with most new materials it can take years for commercial production to scale up to the point of mass­market adoption. Petroleum-­based carbon­fibre composites were invented in the 1950s, but it took more than 30 years before they began to be used in significant quantities in aircraft and cars. Graphene is now moving in that direction. According to estimates by idTechEx, a firm of analysts based in Cambridge, the world’s annual production capacity of the material was less than 3,000 tonnes in the first quarter of 2019. By the first quarter of this year, that figure had more than quadrupled, to 12,700 tonnes.

7. Novel production methods, such as Levidian Nanosystems’ and others being developed around the world, are assisting this growth. Besides methane, graphene is being made from an increasing range of materials, including waste and discarded mixed plastics, which otherwise might end up in landfill. This avoids “exfoliating” mined graphite, which at present is the dominant manufacturing process.

8.Graphite, the common form of **crystalline carbon** (the rarer one being diamond) is, in essence, a lot of layers of graphene piled on top of one another. Indeed, to make their discovery, Dr Geim and Dr Novoselov simply used sticky tape to peel individual layers away from a **graphite** block. As that is a bit too tedious for industrial use, various chemical and mechanical methods have been developed to speed things up.

9.Two of the world’s biggest suppliers, for example, use** proprietary** water­based processes to do the **exfoliation**. NanoXplore, in Montreal, Canada, recently upped its capacity to 4,000 tonnes a year, and Sixth Element Materials Technology, a firm based in Changzhou, China, plans to expand its 1,000­-tonne annual capacity.

10.The various grades of graphene produced by exfoliation are not necessarily green, though. Graphite is not a renewable resource and it has to be mined, which can be environmentally damaging. As an alternative some producers obtain their **feedstock** elsewhere. This can be as organic compounds in **gaseous** form, such as methane, or as liquids like **ethanol**, an alcohol that can be made from plant matter. These are used in** chemical vapour deposition** (cvd), a long established industrial process. cvd relies on a chemical reaction, sometimes in combination with heat and a **catalyst**, to deposit carbon atoms turned into a vapour onto a substrate, such as copper or **nickel**. The** substrate **can then be removed, if desired, and the graphene recovered.

11. Levidian Nanosystems employs yet another approach, which it calls loop. This process uses microwaves to turn methane (a molecule composed of a carbon atom and four hydrogens) into a **plasma** by stripping electrons from its molecules. This causes the** chemical bond**s holding the molecule together to break, thus creating hydrogen (which is extracted from the top of the reaction chamber) and high­quality graphene (which collects at the bottom). The process does not rely on any catalysts.

12.The idea is that  loop can be used to strip carbon from methane gas flows, such as those found in various industrial processes, water­-treatment plants and** biogas **reactors, as well as oil wells and landfill sites. That gets rid of methane, a potent pollutant, without generating CO2—which would be an inevitable outcome if the methane were, instead, burned. The hydrogen that is made can then be burned as fuel without producing any greenhouse gases and the graphene sold for other applications, such as an** additive** to** toughen anti­corrosion paint**—in exactly the same way that the grey paint used to protect Levidian’s shipping container from the elements has been treated.

13.Although Levidian began as a graphene producer, it now sees its role as providing a **decarbonisation** service. The loop system is being tested by Britain’s National Grid, which is responsible for the distribution of the country’s gas and electricity, to boost the amount of hydrogen in the gas supply. The main ingredient of natural gas is methane, and decarbonising it in this way can produce up to a 40% reduction in CO2 emissions when the gas is subsequently burnt,according to John Hartley, Levidian’s boss. As for the graphene, National Grid plans to use that to reinforce its pipelines so that they can carry more hydrogen.

14.Depending on the source of the methane, Levidian claims the loop process has both a lower cost and a lower environmental impact than other means of making hydrogen—in particular, steam reformation, which generates a lot of CO2. In fact, at current market prices, the sale of the graphene produced means the hydrogen comes free. In time, the company hopes the loop process can be **scaled up** to become a big producer of the gas.

15.James Tour and his colleagues at Rice University in Houston, Texas, have cast their net even wider in the search for alternative feedstocks to make graphene. So far, they have successfully tried coal, **petroleum coke** (a by­product of **oil­-refining**),discarded food, old tyres and mixed­plastic waste.

16.To carry out the conversion, Dr Tour uses a method called the “flash” process that his team have developed. This employs a specially designed reaction chamber in which a carbon­containing material is sandwiched between a pair of electrodes. High­energy pulses of electricity are then used to create a rapid rise in temperature to 2,700°C. In only a second or so, this results in a sudden flash of light (hence the name) caused by the release of energy as molecules in the material **disintegrate**.
