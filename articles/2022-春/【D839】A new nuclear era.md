# # D839   A new nuclear era 
### **Withis threats to use the bomb, Russia’s president has overturned the nuclear order **
1. One hundred days ago Vladimir Putin launched his invasion of Ukraine by warning of a nuclear strike. Having **exalted** Russia’s atomic **arsenal** and promised Ukraine’s **subjugation,** he threatened countries tempted to interfere with consequences “such as you have never seen in your entire history”. Russian tv has since **tantalised **viewers with **chit-chat** abou**t Armageddon**.

2.Even if he never uses the bomb in Ukraine, Mr Putin has thus already upset the nuclear order. After his threats, nato limited the support it was prepared to offer, with two implications that are all the more worrying for having been drowned out by the drumbeat of Russia’s conventional campaign. One is that vulnerable states that see the world through Ukraine’s eyes will feel that the best defence against a nuclear-armed aggressor is to have weapons of their own. The other is that other nuclear-armed states will believe that they can gain by copying Mr Putin’s tactics. If so, someone somewhere will surely turn their threat into reality. That must not be this war’s devastating legacy.

3. The nuclear danger was growing before the invasion. North Korea has dozens of **warhead**s. Iran, the un said this week, has enough enriched **uranium** for its first bomb. Although the New start treaty will limit Russia’s and America’s intercontinental **ballistic** missiles until 2026, it does not cover weapons such as nuclear **torpedoe**s. Pakistan is rapidly adding to its arsenal. China is modernising its nuclear forces and, the Pentagon says, expanding them.

> **ballistic**：弹道（学）的；发射的
 > 
> **intercontinental **：洲际的
 > 
> **uranium**：铀
 > 
> **torpedoe**：鱼雷
 > 

4.All this **proliferation** reflects the weakening of the moral **revulsion** that restrains the use of nuclear weapons. As memories of **Hiroshima** and **Nagasaki** fade, people fail to grasp how the **detonation** of a small battlefield weapon, of the sort Mr Putin might lob, could escalate into the **tit-for-tat** **annihilation** of entire cities. America and the Soviet Union only just coped with a two-sided nuclear **stand-off**. There is insufficient alarm at the prospect of many nuclear powers struggling to keep the peace.

 > 
> **annihilation**：覆灭；歼灭(敌人)

> **stand-off**：僵局；困局

5. The invasion of Ukraine adds to this** malaise**. Even if Mr Putin is bluffing, his threats** eat away** at the security guarantees given to non-nuclear states. In 1994 Ukraine surrendered the ex-Soviet nuclear weapons on its territory in exchange for **undertaking**s from Russia, America and Britain that it would not be attacked. By seizing **Crimea** and backing separatists in the Donbas regions in 2014, Russia **flagrantly **broke that promise. America and Britain, which pretty much** stood aside**, broke their promises, too.

> **malaise**：难以捉摸的问题

> **undertaking**：承诺；保证

> **flagrantly **：明目张胆地

> **stood aside**：（stand aside）站开；避开；不参加

6.This gives vulnerable states an extra reason to go nuclear. Iran may judge that, whereas **renouncing** the bomb will win it no lasting credit, having one would now stir up less trouble than in the past. If Iran tested a bomb, how would Saudi Arabia and Turkey respond? South Korea and Japan, which both have the know-how to arm themselves, will place less faith in Western commitments to protect them in a more dangerous world.

> **renounce**：声明放弃；宣布放弃；宣布与…决裂
 > 

7. Mr Putin’s strategy of issuing nuclear threats is even more **corrosive**. In the decades after the second world war, the nuclear powers **contemplated** deploying atomic weapons in battle. But in the past half-century such warnings have been issued only against countries, such as Iraq and North Korea, that were themselves threatening to use weapons of mass destruction. Mr Putin is different because he is invoking atomic threats to help his invading forces win a** conventional war**.

> **corrosive**:侵蚀性的；损害性的
 > 
> **contemplate:**考虑；沉思；思量
 > 
> **conventional war:**(不使用核武器的)常规战争
 > 

8.And it seems to have worked. True, nato’s support for Ukraine has been more **robust **than expected. But the alliance has hesitated to dispatch “offensive” weapons such as aircraft. Although America’s president, Joe Biden, has sent vast amounts of arms, this week he **demurred** from providing missiles able to strike deep inside Russia. Others in nato seem to think that Ukraine should settle with Russia, because inflicting a defeat on Mr Putin could back him into a corner, with **dire** consequences.

> **robust **:强壮的；结实的；耐用的
 > 
> **demur:**表示反对；提出异议；拒绝
 > 
> **dire:**极其严重的；危急的；极糟的
 > 

9. That logic sets a dangerous precedent. China could impose similar conditions if it attacked Taiwan, arguing that the island is already Chinese territory. More states may **amass** more battlefield weapons. That would flout the Nuclear Non-proliferation Treaty, under which they are pledged to work for disarmament.

> **amass** :（尤指大量）积累
 > 
> **disarmament**:裁减军备（尤指核武器）
 > 

10.Mr Putin’s damage will be hard to repair. The Treaty on the Prohibition of Nuclear Weapons, which came into force last year and is backed by 86 states, calls for their** abolition**. However, countries with weapons fear leaving themselves more vulnerable, even if collective disarmament might make sense.

> **abolition**:废除；取消
 > 

11. Arms control, with** scrupulous** verification, is worth pursuing. Russia may be** wary**, but it is **impoverished**. **Nukes** cost money and it needs to rebuild its conventional forces. America could retire its land-based missiles without compromising its security in exchange for Russian cuts. Both sides could agree on technical measures, such as not to strike nuclear command, control and communications infrastructure in a conventional conflict. Ultimately, the aim should be to bring in China.

> **scrupulous:**仔细的；细致的；一丝不苟的
 > 
> **wary:**谨慎的；机警的；小心翼翼的
 > 
> **impoverished:**赤贫的；不名一文的
 > 
> **nuke:**核武器；核电站
 > 

12.Those talks will be easier if Mr Putin’s nuclear tactics fail—starting with ensuring he does not strike Ukraine. Mr Biden wrote this week that America has not detected preparations. But countries such as China, India, Israel and Turkey with access to the **Kremlin** should be warning Mr Putin of their** fury** if, God forbid, he actually uses a nuclear weapon.

> **fury**:狂怒；狂暴
 > 
> **Kremlin**:克里姆林宫的
 > 

13. Sparing Ukraine from a nuclear attack is essential, but it is not enough. The world must also make certain that Mr Putin does not **prosper** from his aggression today, as he prospered in 2014. If, once again, he believes that his tactics worked, he will issue more nuclear threats in the future. If he concludes nato can be** intimidated**, persuading him that he must back down will be harder. Others will learn from his example. Ukraine therefore needs advanced weapons, economic aid and sanctions on Russia in order to force Mr Putin’s army into a retreat.

> **spare:**抽出；匀出；饶恕
 > 
> **prosper:**繁荣；成功；发达
 > 
> **intimidated:**胆怯；怯场
 > 

14. Those countries that see this as just a passing European fight are neglecting their own security. And those arguing in the name of peace that Ukraine needs a** truce** with Russia right now, to avoid being **bogged down** in a war it cannot win with an enemy that has already lost its sting, could not be more wrong. If Mr Putin thought nato lacked **resolve **Russia would remain dangerous. If he were convinced that his nuclear threats had been the difference between defeat and a face-saving **stalemate**, Russia would be more dangerous than ever.
