# # D845  Scapegoating Africans 
### **South Africans should not blame immigrants for their country’s failings **
1. In 1995, a year after becoming South Africa’s first black president, Nelson Mandela gave a speech in **Alexandra**, a **township** in **Johannesburg**. “It saddens and angers me to see the rising hatred of foreigners,” he said, **chastising **residents for destroying migrants’ homes. “We cannot blame other people for our troubles.” Under Mandela, the African National Congress (anc), many of whose **fugitive** leaders had been sheltered by other African countries during apartheid, **took in **Africans fleeing wars in Congo, Somalia and elsewhere. The new government also made it easier for Africans to work and settle in South Africa.

2.They have not always felt welcome. **Xenophobic** locals occasionally attacked immigrants in the 1990s in poor urban areas like Alexandra, and there was more widespread violence against foreigners in 2008. In general, however, South African politicians have refrained from **inciting** such horrors. Unfortunately, that is changing. Today politicians from several parties are **vying** to see who can blame immigrants most loudly for the country’s **self-­inflicted **problems (see Middle East & Africa section). The **virulence** of their rhetoric varies, but the consequence is the same: life for immigrants has grown **nastier** and more **perilous**.

3. ** Vigilante** groups are growing in strength. They spread wild rumours on social media. They stomp around townships, demanding (illegally) to check foreigners’ identity documents. Sometimes, they inflict **mob** justice. Astonishingly, one in eight South Africans say they have taken part in “violent action” against immigrants; almost as many say they would be prepared to do so. Most South Africans think migrants commit more crimes (they don’t) and “steal” local jobs (studies suggest that they tend to boost both gdp and employment).

4.Instead of **rebut**ting these baseless beliefs, political entrepreneurs seek to exploit them. Actionsa, a new right­wing populist party; the Economic Freedom Fighters, a hard­left **outfit**; and ethnicity­-based parties such as the **Inkatha Freedom Party** and the Patriotic Alliance, all fan fear of foreigners to **woo** votes away from the anc, which is expected to lose its majority in the next election in 2024.

> **woo**:争取…的支持；寻求…的赞同

5. Anxious to cling to power, the ruling party has responded by treating foreigners more harshly. The processing of **asylum** applications has **ground to a halt**. Some provinces want to restrict foreign ownership of township shops. A new immigration system promises to make it harder for firms to hire non­citizens. And the government says it will no longer renew residence permits used by many **Zimbabweans** since the ruin of their country in the late 2000s. Before long, they will face a grim choice: live in the shadows or be deported **en masse **to a failing state.

> **asylum**:庇护；收容所；避难所

6. It is perhaps not surprising that friction arises between immigrants and poor South Africans. Tensions are common in many countries, especially during hard times. And life in the rainbow nation is certainly hard. The official unemployment rate is 35%. Prices of food and fuel are rising. The politicians in charge of many towns have proved bett（er at looting than supplying public services. Schools have only marginally improved since the end of apartheid—a system that deliberately deprived black people of education. However, the blame for these modern ills lies squarely with the ruling party, not with immigrants.

7. So instead of scapegoating people who cannot vote, the government should try to govern better: by curbing corruption, improving public services and making South Africa an easier place to do business. More specifically, to restore public confidence in its immigration system it should get a grip on its borders, by firming the **crooked** officials who wave people across illicitly. It should make it easier for migrants to plug skills shortages, which aggravate the difficulty South Africa already has keeping the water flowing and the lights on. And rather than barring firms from hiring unskilled migrants it should make it easier to hire anyone—looser labour rules would mostly benefit jobless South Africans. It should also support free and fair elections in Zimbabwe, without which the awful regime there will remain in power and carry on driving its citizens to emigrate.

8.Many countries in Africa are trying to open their borders. The African Union has proposed that its members follow the European Union and embrace freedom of movement. The 15­country regional bloc in west Africa has gone furthest in making that aim a reality; an east African bloc is growing more liberal, too. South Africa, which aspires to lead the continent, ought to be at the **vanguard** of such eforts. Instead it is an outlier.
