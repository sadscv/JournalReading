# D866 A wise manifesto for digital democracy
> **manifesto**: 宣言
 > 

1 The internet was once **billed** as a new electronic frontier of unbounded freedom. Nowadays it tends to offer only a **manipulative**, “click-to-consent” illusion of autonomy. This evolution is not surprising, argues Jamie Susskind, a British **barrister** who studies technology’s relationship with society. Code carries power: the power to determine what choices users get, to gather data on them and to shape their perceptions. Those who **wield** it—the “autocrats of information”, in a phrase borrowed from **Ada Lovelace**, a 19th-century coding pioneer—are mostly invisible and **unaccountable**. As life becomes more networked, citizens come to feel dominated by it and its **overlord**s.

> **bill**: 把（某人或事物）宣传为…

> **manipulative**：善于操纵的；会控制的；会摆布人的

2 Mr Susskind wants to restrain this unaccountable power, much as 18th-century democrats did for the state and 19th-century reformers for corporations. His idea is to apply the principles of republicanism to it. Mr Susskind is no **Luddite**: he does not imagine tech’s power could be eliminated, even if that were **desirable**. Rather, he wants new rules and institutions “to expose that power, to make it **answerable**, to **disperse** it, to restrain it and to make sure it cannot be used by one group to dominate others.”

3 The book’s diagnosis of the threat is persuasive, if partly familiar. Rather than following Black Lives Matter activists, police can now buy their data from social-media companies, a “big **brotherhood**” of private **surveillance**. Twitter hides tweets with only the **vaguest** explanations and **cursory** **due process**. Polarising suggestion algorithms on YouTube and Facebook obstruct citizens’ freedom to gain an objective picture of the world. Artificial-intelligence programs that pick job candidates exacerbate the racial and gender bias in the real-world data they are trained on.
The reach and **granularity** of code are unprecedented. Thomas Hobbes wrote that regulating “all the actions, and words of men” was “a thing impossible”, Mr Susskind notes. “But it seems much more possible now—and the rules are coming from private authorities, not just public ones.”

> **brotherhood:** 兄弟会；宗教（或政治等）组织an organization formed for a particular purpose, especially a religious society or political organization
>
> **surveillance**：（对犯罪嫌疑人或可能发生犯罪的地方的）监视the act of carefully watching a person suspected of a crime or a place where a crime may be committed
>
> **vague**: 糊的；不明确的
>
> **cursory**: 粗略的；仓促的；草率的
>
> **due process**: 正当手续
>
> **granularity**：粒度；颗粒度；封锁粒度
>
> **Code granularity:代码的粒度**

4 Part of the problem, he thinks, is the philosophy of market individualism that has structured internet governance. For markets to function, consumers need information and choice. But code is invisible, and the information **asymmetry** between the average user and Google is **titanic.** (What determines which search results land in your top ten? Who knows?) Worse, people struggle to **opt out of** most digital systems. Scanners track the movements of Amazon workers; the owners of iPhones have no idea what is in Apple’s terms and conditions. The European Union’s gdpr data-protection law does not enhance freedom by asking you about cookies 50 times a day. In the digital world, “consent” is often meaningless.

> **asymmetry**：不对称性；非对称性；不对称的
>
> **titanic**：巨大的；强大的；极端重要的
>
> **opt out of**: 决定退出；决定不参加

5 Digital republicanism would replace this philosophy with one that prioritises society’s health and citizens’ freedom. Laws governing it should ensure that it preserves democracy, reduces the domination of some groups (including the tech industry) over others, mirrors the ethical culture of the host society and minimises government **intrusion**. Mr Susskind suggests a number of new institutions to help.

> **intrusion**：侵入；闯入；侵犯
>

6 Online **tribunals**, already functioning in Canada, could provide quick **due process** for digital **flashpoint**s like social-media suspensions. Taiwan has pioneered an online platform for consensus-building national **deliberation**s. Data unions could help citizens protect and collectively market their data. Programmers could be required to take ethics courses; tech firms might be subject to government certification and a duty of openness in their code.

> **tribunal**：法庭；审判员席；制裁
>
> **due process**: 正当手续
>
> **flashpoint:** （暴力或愤怒的）一触即发，导火索a situation or place in which violence or anger starts and cannot be controlled
>
> **deliberation**: 审议；考虑；商议

7 These reforms sound promising. But Mr Susskind’s book is a bit **skimpy** on how they might come about. The republican arguments of James Madison changed the world not just through force of rhetoric, but because they **chimed with** the interests of the new classes and industries of the dawning age of capitalism. Who might embrace the **cause** of digital republicanism is less clear. Generation Z **frets** **over** unaccountable power in tech, but tends to discuss it in terms of platform-denial, safe spaces, ratios and **gaslighting**. Initiatives such as a duty of openness may be better policy. But who will fight for them?

> **skimpy**：不够的；吝啬的；不足的；小而暴露的；
>
> **chime with **: 与……相一致
>
> **cause**: 事业，目标，思想an organization or idea that people support or fight for
>
> **fret over/about sth**：对......苦恼；烦躁；焦虑不安

> **煤气灯效应**（英语：Gaslighting）是一种心理操纵的形式，其方法是一个人或一个团体隐秘地让受害人逐渐开始怀疑自己，使他们质疑自己的记忆力，感知力或判断力，其结果是导致受害者的认知失调和其他变化，例如低下的自我尊重。因为其使用否定，误导，矛盾和错误资讯，煤气灯效应使受害者心理上去稳定化以及使受害者不再相信她/他们原来的的信仰。在现实案例中的范围，可以从受虐者否认先前发生过虐待事件，到虐待者意图使受害者迷失方向的怪异事件的发生。

> 该术语起源于剧本《煤气灯（英语：Gas Light）》（Gas Light，1938年，但最初在美国以“安吉尔街”为名称演出）及其1940年和1944年的改编版电影。该术语已用于临床心理学文献[1] :31–46 [2]以及政治评论和哲学中。 [3]
