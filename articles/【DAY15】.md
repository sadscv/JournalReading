# DAY 15 Let them wed
1 MARRIAGE may be for the ages—but it changes by the year. And never, perhaps, has it changed as quickly as since the 1960s. In western law, wives are now equal rather than subordinate partners; interracial
marriage is now widely accepted both in **statute** and in society;
marital failure itself, rather than the fault of one partner, may be
grounds for a split. With change, alas, has come strain. In the 25 years
from 1960, divorce rates soared throughout the west—more than
sextupled in Britain, where divorce appears inevitable for the world's
most celebrated marriage, that of Charles and Diana Windsor.

2 Struggling to keep law apace with reality, Britain's Tory government is even now advancing another marriage reform, seeking, on the whole
sensibly, to make quick or impulsive divorce harder but no-fault

3 That, however, is not the kind of reform which some decidedly unTory people are seeking—and have begun to achieve. Denmark,
Norway and Sweden now allow homosexual partners to register with
the state and to claim many (though not all) of the prerogatives of
marriage. The Dutch are moving in the same direction. In France and
Belgium, cities and local governments have begun recognising gay
partnerships. And, in the American state of Hawaii, a court case may
legalise homosexual marriage itself.

4 As of today, however, there is no country which gives homosexuals
the full right of marriage. And that is what gay activists in more and
more places are seeking. Marriage, one might think, is in turbulent
enough waters already. Can gay marriage be a good idea—now?

5 To understand why the answer is yes, first set aside a view whose
appealing simplicity is its undoing. “Governments are not elected to
arrange nuptial liaisons, much less to untangle them,” writes Joe
Rogaly in the Financial Times. “It is a purely private matter.” On this
libertarian view, the terms of a marriage contract should be the
partners' business, not the state's. With the help of lawyers and
sympathetic churchmen, homosexuals can create for themselves
what is in all practical respects a marriage; if they lack a government
licence, so what?

6The government-limiting impulse motivating this view is admirable.
But, in truth, the state's involvement in marriage is both inevitable
and indispensable. Although many kinds of human pairings are
possible, state-sanctioned marriage is, tautologically, the only one
which binds couples together in the eyes of the law.

7By doing so it confers upon partners unique rights to make life-or death medical decisions, rights to inheritance, rights to share
pensions and medical benefits; just as important, it confers upon
each the legal responsibilities of guardianship and care of the other.
Far from being frills, these benefits and duties go to the very core of
the marriage contract; no church or employer or “commitment
ceremony” can bestow them at one blow. If marriage is to do all the
things that society demands of it, then the state must set some rules.

8Just so, say traditionalists: and those rules should exclude
homosexuals. Gay marriage, goes the argument, is both frivolous and
dangerous: frivolous because it blesses unions in which society has
no particular interest; dangerous because anything which trivialises
marriage undermines this most basic of institutions. Traditionalists
are right about the importance of marriage. But they are wrong to see
gay marriage as trivial or frivolous.

9 It is true that the single most important reason society cares about
marriage is for the sake of children. But society's stake in stable, longterm partnerships hardly ends there. Marriage remains an economic
bulwark. Single people (especially women) are economically
vulnerable, and much more likely to fall into the arms of the welfare
state. Furthermore, they call sooner upon public support when they
need care—and, indeed, are likelier to fall ill (married people, the
numbers show, are not only happier but considerably healthier). Not
least important, marriage is a great social stabiliser of men.

10 Homosexuals need emotional and economic stability no less than
heterosexuals—and society surely benefits when they have it. “Then
let them 'unchoose' homosexuality and marry someone of the
opposite sex,” was the old answer. Today that reply is untenable.
Homosexuals do not choose their condition; indeed, they often try
desperately hard, sometimes to the point of suicide, to avoid it.
However, they are less and less willing either to hide or to lead lives of
celibacy. For society, the real choice is between homosexual marriage
and homosexual alienation. No social interest is served by choosing

11To this principle of social policy, add a principle of government.
Barring a compelling reason, governments should not discriminate
between classes of citizens. As recently as 1967, blacks and whites in
some American states could not wed. No one but a crude racist would
defend such a rule now. Even granting that the case of homosexuals is
more complex than the case of miscegenation, the state should
presume against discriminating—especially when handing out something as important as a marriage licence. Thus the question
becomes: is there a compelling reason to bar homosexuals from

12One objection is simply that both would-be spouses are of the same
sex. That is no answer; it merely repeats the question. Perhaps, then,
once homosexuals can marry, marital anarchy will follow? That might
be true if homosexual unions were arbitrary configurations, mere
parodies of “real” marriage. But the truth is that countless
homosexual couples, especially lesbian ones, have shown that they
are as capable of fidelity, responsibility and devotion as are
heterosexual couples—and this despite having to keep their unions
secret, at least until recently. Would gay marriage weaken the
standard variety? There is little reason to think so. Indeed, the
opposite seems at least as likely: permitting gay marriage could
reaffirm society's hope that people of all kinds settle down into stable

13The question of children in homosexual households—adoption,
especially—is thorny. That question, however, is mainly separate
from the matter of marriage as such. In settling a child with guardians
who are not the natural parents, the courts and adoption agencies will
consider a variety of factors, just as they do now; a couple's
homosexuality may be one such factor (though it need not, by itself,

14 In the end, leaving aside (as secular governments should) objections
that may be held by particular religions, the case against homosexual
marriage is this: people are unaccustomed to it. It is strange and
radical. That is a sound argument for not pushing change along
precipitously. Certainly it is an argument for legalising homosexual
marriage through consensual politics (as in Denmark), rather than by
court order (as may happen in America). But the direction of change is
clear. If marriage is to fulfill its aspirations, it must be defined by the
commitment of one to another for richer for poorer, in sickness and
in health—not by the people it excludes
