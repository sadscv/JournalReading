# D821 A hawk on the wing II
8.In the long run, he says, the West must help Ukraine through a “doctrine of deterrence by denial. So that even without invoking the question of nato membership, Ukraine is being given nato-**compatible** weaponry, training and intelligence sharing of such quality and quantity that no one will ever invade Ukraine again.”

9.Mr Johnson’s **hawkish** tone is not shared by other European leaders. In a speech on May 9th President Emmanuel Macron of France suggested a means must be found to spare Russia “humiliation”. Mr Johnson discounts this concern. “It is one of the paradoxical advantages of the situation that the strength of Putin’s popular support gives him the opportunity actually to be completely flexible. And to say, for instance, that certain objectives have been achieved, ‘**denazification**’, whatever, and that’s why the operation is over.”

10.Mr Macron’s idea of a community of eu and non-eu states that co-operate on security, migration and more is also likely to **fall on stony ground**. “I think most **fair-minded** observers would say that after some sort of initial anxieties and hesitations, an independent UK foreign policy has really been important,” says Mr Johnson. “I think that our ability to take decisions at speed, to be out in front, to campaign for outcomes that we want, that we think are right has been very valuable…we are able to give a lead in a different way.”

11.Fair-minded observers might also point out that Britain has been far from the biggest donor to Ukraine, in cash terms or as a share of gdp, and not particularly generous in taking refugees. But its policy has had a **nimbleness** which has won Mr Johnson a genuine and widespread gratitude in Ukraine itself. Britain was dispatching anti-tank weapons before the invasion began; Mr Johnson was the first western European leader to walk the streets of Kyiv after the **repulse** of the Russian assault, and the first to address its parliament.

12.Mr Johnson is hardly the architect of Britain’s policy in Ukraine, notes Robin Niblett of Chatham House, a think-tank. Rather, he has been following a **trajectory**, largely shaped by the Ministry of Defence, of preparing Ukraine against Russian aggression that has been in place since 2015. But the prime minister deserves credit for not **recoiling** as the crisis emerged, says Mr Niblett. “He’s been looking for a bigger purpose for British policy. Sometimes history throws you a card, and your positioning could be just right.”

13.The contrast with Mr Johnson’s timidity at home is striking. A fear of aggravating his **backbench** mps and core voters was on full display on May 10th in a safety-first Queen’s Speech, which laid out the government’s legislative programme for the coming parliamentary **session**. His **bombast** often seems **clownish**, his character questionable, and his judgment weak: threats to **rip up** Britain’s deal with the eu over trade arrangements in Northern Ireland are deeply wrong-headed.

14.But on Ukraine at least, and in his commitments to Sweden and Finland, flourish and boldness have served Mr Johnson well. His predecessor, Theresa May, flew on a plane decked in dull air-force grey. These days it is **liveried** in red, white and blue, with gold lettering down the **fuselage**.
