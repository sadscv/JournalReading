# D815 India’s next decade
1.Over the past three years India has endured **more than its share** of bad news and suffering. The pandemic has killed between 2.2m and 9.7m people. Lockdowns caused the economy to shrink temporarily by a quarter and triggered the largest internal migrations since partition in 1947, as city workers fled to their villages. Religious tensions have been **simmering**, stoked by the anti­Muslim **chauvinism** of the Bharatiya Janata Party (bjp), in power since 2014 under the strongman prime minister, Narendra Modi. Now a heatwave is baking the north of the country and the global oil­ and food­price shock is battering the poor.
(one's) fair share (of something)：All that one deserves, expects, or is entitled to, whether that be a good or a bad thing. Usually preceded by "more than" to indicate an excessive amount.

> **partition:**分割；分治
 > 
> **simmer**:煨；徐徐沸腾；(危机等)处于酝酿中
 > 
> **chauvinism**:沙文主义an aggressive and unreasonable belief that your own country is better than all others
 > 

2.Yet as our Briefing explains, if you take a step back, a novel confluence of forces stands to transform India’s economy over the next decade, improving the lives of 1.4bn people and changing the balance of power in Asia. Technological leaps, the energy transition and geopolitical shifts are creating new opportunities—and new tools to fix **intractable** problems. The biggest threat to all this is India’s **incendiary** politics (see Asia section).

> **confluence**：（河流的）汇流点，（人或物的）聚集，合并
 > 
> **intractable:**很难对付（或处理）的
 > 
> **incendiary**：纵火的；能引起燃烧的；煽动的
 > 

3.Since India opened up in 1991, its economy has prompted both **euphoria** and despair. One minute it is the next China: a rising superpower bursting with enterprising geniuses. The next it is a **demographic** **time­bomb** unable to generate hope for its young people; or a Wild West where Vodafone and other naive multinationals are **fleeced.** Over the past decade India has outgrown most other big countries, yet this has been overshadowed by a sense of disappointment. It has not engineered the manufacturing surge that enriched East Asia nor built enough big companies to **marshal** capital for development. Its fragmented markets and informal firms create few good jobs.

> **euphoria**：极度愉快的心情
 > 
> **time­bomb：**定时炸弹；潜在危险
 > 
> **demographic：**人口的；人口学的
 > 
> **fleece:**v.诈取；剪(羊)毛
 > 
> **fleeced**：adj.(羊毛般)盖满；
 > 
> **marshal** ：结集；收集；安排

4.As the country emerges from the pandemic, however, a new pattern of growth is visible. It is unlike anything you have seen before. An **indigenous** tech effort is key. As the cost of technology has dropped, India has rolled out a national “tech stack”: a set of state-­sponsored digital services that link ordinary Indians with an electronic identity, payments and tax systems, and bank accounts. The rapid adoption of these platforms is forcing a vast, inefficient, informal cash economy into the 21st century. It has **turbocharged** the world’s third-­largest startup scene after America’s and China’s.

> **indigenous:**土著的；原产的；本乡本土的
 > 
> **turbocharged:**增强(功能)
 > 

5.Alongside that, global trends are creating bigger business clusters. The IT services industry has doubled in size in a decade, helped by the cloud and a worldwide shortage of software workers. Where else can Western firms find half a million new engineers a year? There is a renewable energy investment **spree**: India ranks third for solar installations and is pioneering green hydrogen. As firms everywhere **reconfigure** supply chains to lessen their reliance on China, India’s attractions as a manufacturing location have risen, helped by a $26bn subsidy scheme. Western governments are keen to forge defence and technology links. India has also found a **work-around** to redistribute more to ordinary folk who vote but rarely see immediate gains from economic reforms: a direct, real­time, digital welfare system that in 36 months has paid $200bn to about 950m people.

> **spree**:放纵
 > 
> **reconfigure**:重新配置
 > 
> **work-around:**通的方法；应急措施
 > 

6.These changes will not lead to a manufacturing boom as big as those in South Korea or China, which created enough jobs to empty the fields of farmers. They do not solve deep problems such as extreme weather or **clogged** courts. But they do help explain why India is forecast to be the world’s fastest-­growing big economy in 2022 and why it has a chance of holding on to that title for years. Growth generates more wealth to invest in the country’s human capital, particularly hospitals and schools.

> **clog:** 影响;妨碍**;**堵塞
 > 
> 印度并不通畅的法院体系已经积压了大量的案件。

7.Who deserves the credit? Chance has played a big role: India did not create the Sino­American split or the cloud, but benefits from both. So has the steady accumulation of **piecemeal** reform over many governments. The digital­-identity scheme and new national tax system were **dreamed up** a decade or more ago.

> **Piecemeal**:(变化或过程) 逐渐而零碎的 [表不满]'
 > 
> **dream up**：虚构出; 凭空设想出
 > 

8.Mr Modi’s government has also got a lot right. It has backed the tech stack and direct welfare, and persevered with the painful task of shrinking the informal economy. It has found pragmatic fixes. Central­-government purchases of solar power have kick­-started renewables. Financial reforms have made it easier to float young firms and bankrupt bad ones. Mr Modi’s electoral **prowess** provides economic continuity. Even the opposition expects him to be in power well after the election in 2024.

> **prowess**:非凡的技能；高超的技艺；造诣
 > 

9.The danger is that over the next decade this dominance hardens into autocracy. One risk is the bjp’s **abhorrent** hostility towards Muslims, which it uses to rally its political base. Companies tend to shrug this off, judging that Mr Modi can keep tensions under control and that **capital flight** will be limited. Yet violence and **deteriorating** human rights could lead to stigma that impairs India’s access to Western markets. The bjp’s desire for religious and linguistic conformity in a huge, diverse country could be destabilising. Were the party to impose **Hindi** as the national language, **secessionist** pressures would grow in some wealthy states that pay much of the taxes.

> **abhorrent :**讨厌的；跟…不合的
 > 
> **Capital flight**：资金外逃
 > 
> **deteriorate**:日益恶化；退化
 > 
> **secessionist**：分离主义者
 > 
> **Hindi:**印地语（印度官方语言之一，尤通用于印度北部）
 > 

10.The quality of decision-­making could also deteriorate. Prickly and **vindictive**, the government has **co­opted** the bureaucracy to bully the press and the courts. A **botched** decision to abolish bank notes in 2016 showed Mr Modi’s impulsive side. A strongman lacking checks and balances can eventually endanger not just democracy, but also the economy: think of President Recep Tayyip Erdogan in Turkey, whose bizarre views on inflation have caused a currency crisis. And, given the **bjp**’s **ambivalence** towards foreign capital, the campaign for national renewal risks **regressing** into protectionism. The party loves blank cheques from Silicon Valley but is **wary** of foreign firms competing in India. Today’s targeted subsidies could degenerate into **autarky** and **cronyism**—the tendencies that have long held India back.

> **vindictive:**报复性的；怀恨的
 > 
> **coopt**：（经所有成员同意）增补……为新成员；任命（为同事或助理）；加入团体（派系、运动或文化）；笼络，拉拢
 > 
> **botched**：adj. （尤指工作）一团糟的v. 笨拙地弄糟（botch 的过去式和过去分词）
 > 
> **ambivalence：**矛盾心理(如又爱又憎)
 > 
> **bjp：**印度人民党(Bharatiya Janata Party)
 > 
> **regress:** 回归；倒退；退回
 > 
> **wary：**机警的；小心翼翼的
 > 
> **autarky：**自给自足/闭关锁国(政策)
 > 
> **cronyism:**任人唯亲；任用亲信
 > 

11.For India to grow at 7% or 8% for years to come would be **momentous**. It would lift huge numbers of people out of poverty. It would generate a vast new market and manufacturing base for global business, and it would change the global balance of power by creating a bigger counter-weight to China in Asia. Fate, inheritance and **pragmatic** decisions have created a new opportunity in the next decade. It is India’s and Mr Modi’s to **squander**.

> **momentous**：关键的；重要的
 > 
> **pragmatic** ：实用的；务实的
 > 
> **squander：**浪费
