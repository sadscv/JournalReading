# D843 High time for prime time 
1. The essence of what happened on January 6th 2021 is wellknown, if still shocking to recall. A mob stormed the Capitol in Washington, dc, in an effort to prevent Congress from certifying Joe Biden’s election victory. Four people in the crowd died that day, and five police officers in its **aftermath**. Members of Congress had to be rushed to a secure location in a basement. **Rioter**s **erected** a mock **gallow**s and **chanted** “Hang Mike Pence”. And the man who inspired all this was the president himself, who had urged his followers to help overturn his election defeat. As the Republicans’ leader in the Senate, Mitch McConnell, told the Senate a few weeks later, Donald Trump was “practically and morally responsible” for these events: “The people who stormed this building believed they were acting on the wishes and instructions of their president.”

2. So what is the point of the **public hearing**s of the House committee probing the **insurrection** due to start on June 9th (see United States section)? From Thursday’s prime­time **political theatre** to half a dozen sessions that will follow before a final report in September, the coverage will be viewed very differently on either side of a **polarised** country. Commentators on the right will **belittle** it all as a **witch hunt.** And after November’s midterm elections, in which the Republicans look likely to win control of the House, they can be counted on to bury the matter.

3. Yet that ticking clock gives an urgency to the proceedings, which matter profoundly, for three reasons. One flows from the basic workings of democracy: institutions must do their job. It is the task of Congress to probe how an assault on the **Capitol** happened and conclude what lessons can be learned. Its nine­member committee—seven Democrats and two principled Republicans, Liz Cheney and Adam Kinzinger—has gone about it in a **commendably** thorough, **bipartisan** way, despite much resistance. On June 3rd the Department of Justice charged Peter Navarro, a former economic adviser to Mr Trump, for refusing to  co­operate with the committee (though it strangely decided not to act against Mark Meadows, the White House chief of staff at the time of the riot, despite similar **obstructionism**).

4. Second, though the core of the story is known, many vital details are not—especially concerning the extent of the coup’s planning and how directly the president was involved. Some revealing details, such as text messages from Mr Trump’s family to Mr Meadows urging him to persuade his boss to stop the riot, have dribbled out in the course of the committee’s work so far. More can be expected in the public hearings, given that they will draw on information **gleaned** from more than 1,000 **deposition**s and interviews and over 140,000 documents.

> **glean**: 搜集(新闻,资料等)

> **deposition**：书面证词a formal statement, taken from sb and used in court

5. A flow of fresh facts about the depth of **plotting** would reinforce the third reason why these hearings are important: the threat is not over. True, America’s democracy **prevail**ed despite the attack. Members of Congress were eventually able to go back into the chamber and they duly certified the election (**albeit** that, despite the violence that had occurred that day, 138 Republican House members still voted to reject the results in Pennsylvania). Mr Biden became president. But even now 60% of Republicans believe Mr Trump’s lie that the election was stolen. And the party has decided that the insurrection was not serious enough to break with Mr Trump, leaving him the **front­runner** for the Republican nomination in 2024. If Republicans select him, Mr McConnell says he will back him.

> **plotting**: 阴谋；密谋
 > 
> **albeit** ：尽管；虽然
 > 
> **prevail**: 说服；胜；盛行；占上风

> **front­runner**：（赛跑或竞赛中）最可能获胜者

6. Astonishing as it may seem, given what is already known about his efforts to **thwart** the will of the **electorate**, let alone what may be discovered, Mr Trump could well win back the presidency legitimately. In case he does not, his supporters are striving to put in place officials who may make a future challenge to the voters’ **verdict** succeed. The committee’s work, including the public hearings, is a vital part of the **eternal vigilance** that, more than ever, is needed to defend American democracy.
