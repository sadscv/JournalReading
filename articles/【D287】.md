1It was a spectacular bit of timing. On November 16th Baidu, a Chinese online-search giant, said it would buy yy Live, a China-focused video-streaming service with 40m monthly users, for $3.6bn. Two days later Muddy Waters, an American **short-seller**, published a report claiming yy Live was “an ecosystem of **mirages**” and “almost entirely fake”. The share price of joyy, yy Live’s parent company, slid by 26%.

2 Muddy Waters **alleges that** joyy’s platforms, including yy Live, are **infested** with “bots”—computers that log on to “watch” streams, pretending to be human. Many, it says, appear to sit in joyy’s internal networks. The **upshot**, it alleges, is that somewhere between 73% and 84% of joyy’s revenue is suspect.

3 joyy responded by saying the report contained “numerous errors, unsubstantiated statements and misleading conclusions and interpretations”. It said it would be open to “**cash verification and diligence**” conducted by “competent third-party advisers”. (joyy and Baidu did not respond to requests for comment.)

> 以下为欢聚集团反驳浑水报告的声明全文：
>
> 1. 昨日，浑水发布关于JOYY的做空报告，引发市场焦虑和不安，导致股价异常波动。本公司认为，该报告包含大量错误的信息和陈述，以及误导性结论。
>
> 2. 浑水的质疑是因为不了解整个直播行业的商业模式，JOYY相关的运营数据都有同行业数据可参考，符合行业逻辑。直播已成为互联网行业的重要收入手段。已有多家知名的互联网上市公司，以直播作为主要收入来源。
>
> 3. 公司有强大的现金流和现金储备。为了反驳浑水报告对于公司利润真实性的质疑，公司可以提供海内外现金余额和银行存款对账单，被有能力的第三方机构做现金确认和调查。在2020年8月，经董事会同意，在未来三年派息3亿美元，并且在2020年第三季度已支付2500万美元分红，也印证了公司对于强大现金流的信心。

> 4. JOYY收购BIGO时，严格遵循了应有的公司治理流程，并获得了所有必要的批准。自收购20个月以来，BIGO收入从2019年第二季度 1.81亿美元快速增长到2020年第三季度4.90亿美元。在AppAnnie发布的9月全球非游戏类应用的收入排名中，Bigo live排名第六。

> 5. 为了展现公司对长期前景的信心，JOYY将继续执行3亿美元股票回购计划。

4 The allegations are unusual in accusing the platform of creating its own fake users. Technological complexity and minimal human oversight means the “attention economy” is full of virtual eyeballs. But such **mischief** tends to be the work of outsiders. Last year America’s Federal Trade Commission fined the boss of a firm called Devumi $2.5m for selling fake YouTube views, the first time such a complaint had been brought. Digital advertisers pay to have their ads shown to users. It is an open secret that many end up served to fake viewers, generated by computers infected with **malware** written for this purpose.

5 A new report by the University of Baltimore and cheq, an anti-fraud firm, estimates that $35bn is lost annually to such **scams**, from a total market worth $333bn. South-East Asian fraudsters employ humans to **scoot** between racks of smartphones, tapping ads and installing apps, says Gary Danks of Machine, a firm that offers ad-fraud detection. Those in places with higher labour costs simulate phones on computers.

6 Companies are fighting back. Last year Uber sued more than 100 ad agencies, accusing them of buying fake views on its behalf. Facebook launched a lawsuit against firms it says create malware that hijacks users phones, forcing them to generate fake ad clicks. Neither suit is likely to **stem** the fraudsters’ rise.
