## DAY 99 A glut of new coal-fired power stations endangers China’s green ambitions

### Why build them when they struggle to sell their electricity?

1 China is home to half the world’s coal-fired power stations, the most polluting type of generator. Their share of the country’s electricity market is shrinking as nuclear plants and renewables slowly elbow them off the grid. But Chinese investors and local governments are still keen on them. Last year coal-fired generating capacity expanded in China by 37gw \(factoring in plant closures\)—more than the amount by which it grew globally. China has been relaxing curbs on building such plants. That suggests more to come.

2 Work on many of the new coal-fired stations began after the central government gave local officials greater freedom to approve construction at the end of 2014. The aim was to cut red tape, not to ramp up the burning of coal. But it resulted in a blizzard of new permits. Within about a year provinces had approved enough new plants to expand China’s coal-powered generating capacity by a quarter.

3 China does not need a lot more power. Its economy is growing less energy-intensive as it relies less on manufacturing and construction. Lately coal-power plants have been able to sell less than half the electricity they are able to produce, down from 60% a decade ago. But local governments see any big construction project as a potential boost to growth. Some also have coal-mining industries to protect.

4 In 2016, recognising its mistake, the central government began clawing back the authority it had devolved to the provinces. But it worried that halting projects would threaten local economies, so it allowed many of those under way to proceed. Soon it began to relax curbs on the approval of new stations. In January China had 135gw of coal-power capacity either permitted or under construction, says Global Energy Monitor, an ngo in San Francisco. That is equal to about half the total coal-power capacity in America.

5 The new power stations will not be put to full use. They will face fierce competition from renewable energy. China’s capacity for producing this is also growing fast. Plants using coal risk limits on their output imposed by governments to improve air quality. Instead of increasing the total amount of electricity China gets from coal, new stations may simply pinch operating hours from existing ones.

6 That would be a problem for power-firms’ balance sheets. But the world may also suffer. China’s targets to reduce carbon emissions remain too low. The economic blow it has suffered as a result of covid-19 will deter it from making new pledges that could restrain its freedom to boost growth with the help of large and dirty building-projects. The glut of underused, debt-laden power stations could further weaken China’s emissions-cutting resolve.

7 By building so many new coal-fired plants, China has wasted money that could have been spent more greenly, and given vested interests more reason to try to delay its energy transition. The big state-owned firms that operate coal-burning generators are also being relied upon by the government to produce much of China’s renewable energy, notes Lauri Myllyvirta of the Helsinki-based Centre for Research on Energy and Clean Air. But they would rather not hasten the closure of carbon-spewing power stations that they had intended to keep working for a good three decades. ■

## \# DAY 98 Diaries written in adversity can be a source of solace

### The feelings and fears of their authors often chime with today’s

1 The diaries of Virginia Woolf are bookended by wars. Early entries, written when she was a young novelist, describe sheltering in her kitchen during the now-forgotten air-raids over London in 1917. Over nearly three decades she would fill 26 volumes, usually settling down after tea to write up the day or, if she had been laid low by mental illness, as she often was, to recount events spanning weeks or months. Her observations of people, places and books are sometimes catty and prejudiced, often wry and incisive. In October 1940, an established modernist author living in Sussex, she chronicled another conflict:

> _I want to look back on these war years as years of positive something or other…Queer the contraction of life to the village radius. Wood bought enough to stock many winters. All our friends are isolated over winter fires. Chance of interruption small now. No cars. No petrol. Trains uncertain. And we on our lovely free autumn island._

2 Five months later, as she sensed another nervous breakdown approaching, Woolf would drown herself in the River Ouse. Yet on that autumn day she could find solace in the quiet of village life—in “October blooms; brown plough; and the fading and freshening of the marsh.” Her diary is testament to the complex, shifting moods of a brilliant mind, but also to the possibility of finding beauty amid chaos.

3 During a crisis, whether political or personal, writing a diary can be a comfort. In March, as lockdowns were imposed around the world in response to covid-19, columnists advised the quarantined to keep a journal of the warped new reality in which they communicated with loved ones through pixelated screens. Astronauts disclosed how recording their thoughts and dreams helped them endure the loneliness of space. New Zealand’s prime minister, Jacinda Ardern, encouraged people to annotate their days for a more prosaic reason: it could aid in tracing the disease.

4 But for frazzled minds, with attention spans cut by the rolling, roiling news, prying into other lives can be even more therapeutic than documenting your own. Unlike novels, which demand commitment or at least the pretence of it, you can dip in and out of diaries; they are episodic by nature, broken into shards of days, weeks and months. Entries are often hastily written, and can be consumed just as quickly. Sometimes, as with the contraction of Woolf’s world and her isolated friends, they offer unexpected parallels with the pandemic—suggesting that, in the face of very different adversities, people have experienced familiar feelings and fears.

5 Take Samuel Pepys’s diaries, which describe the course of the plague that hit London in 1665, when he was 32. His early entries that year are filled with blithe, gluttonous descriptions of food, plays and women. Arguments with his wife feature prominently. In April he “Lay long in bed, troubled a little with wind, but not much.”

**The uses of adversity**

6 By the end of that month, however, he refers to another ailment: “Great fears of the Sicknesse here in the City, it being said that two or three houses are already shut up.” By June he sees red crosses painted on doors; before long, the “town grows very sickly, and people \[are\] afeared”. Yet still the disease seems distant—disbelief and denial always seem to accompany epidemics—and life and laughter keep breaking in. In the middle of July Pepys shares a water-taxi with a stranger, a “man of love to Musique”, and they “sung together all the way down—with great pleasure”. That evening he “dined well, and mighty merry”. After all the gaiety, he curtly records: “Above 700 dead of the plague this week.”

7 As the months pass, his anxiety rises. He worries about catching a cold and about a servant’s headache. He ponders the plague’s impact on the vogue for the “periwig” \(he has not worn his new one for fear of catching someone else’s lice\). He walks through a changed London: “But Lord, how empty the streets are, and melancholy.”

8 This uncanny sense of a city sliding from familiar to strange recurs in the diaries George Orwell kept during the second world war. “Huge areas of London almost normal,” he observes as the Blitz begins in September 1940, “and everyone quite happy in the daytime…” Four days later, though, he finds Oxford Street empty of traffic and almost deserted, “the late afternoon sun shining straight down the empty roadway and glittering on innumerable fragments of broken glass”.

9 War is not a precise parallel for pandemics, however fond today’s politicians are of martial rhetoric. But war diaries such as Orwell’s are full of moments that resonate now. “As soon as war started the carrying or not carrying of a gas mask assumed social and political implications,” he writes in June 1940, though he might have been talking about masks in the age of covid. “You are still a little stared at if you carry one without being in uniform.” Or take the day in July when he sees a heron flying over Baker Street: “I suppose it is possible that the war, ie the diminution of traffic, tends to increase bird life in inner London.”

**Life to lead**

10 The wartime diaries of Astrid Lindgren, author of “Pippi Longstocking”, highlight the shortages and terror of invasion that gripped even neutral Sweden—and the challenges of motherhood when you have to worry about feeding and entertaining children. Lindgren worked as a censor, learned about overseas atrocities early, and worried that they would happen in Sweden, too. After opening letters describing starvation in Belgium and France she writes: “It makes one feel quite hopeless, sitting at work and reading them.”

11 In many war diaries there is an uneasy tension between headline events and personal tribulations. “Not much news”, Orwell writes, “ie only events of worldwide importance…” Three years into the war Lindgren recalls how “we used to talk about it all the time; now we see it as a necessary evil, to be thought of and talked about as little as possible.” By contrast, in the diaries of Derek Jarman, a British film-maker and artist, the personal and the political fuse.

12 Jarman began his diaries, published in two volumes as “Modern Nature” and “Smiling in Slow Motion”, soon after learning he was hiv-positive, and just before he revealed the diagnosis publicly. Behind the tally of days, weeks and months runs an undercurrent of mortality—a fate that many people, even if they know their death is close, try to ignore. Jarman faces the ultimate, inevitable adversary head on.

13 His record of his last five years is angry, beautiful and haunting by turns. As he grapples with the effects of the disease and the attendant hospital visits, he records the stigma hiv-positive people faced in the 1980s and 1990s, brilliantly articulating the mental toll of a physical illness: “I’m less alive. There’s less life to lead. I can’t give 100% attention to anything—part of me is always thinking about my health.”

14 In “Modern Nature”, which begins in 1989, he reflects on his life as a gay man in London in the 1960s and 1970s, his childhood, the experience of living with a scourge that would kill many close friends, and on things which give him pleasure—including his partner, “HB”, and his garden at Prospect Cottage in Dungeness:

> _Behind the façade my life is at sixes and sevens. I water the roses and wonder whether I will see them bloom. I plant my herbal garden as a panacea, read up on all the aches and pains that plants will cure—and know they are not going to help…Yet there is a thrill in watching the plants spring up that gives me hope._

Just as Woolf found a spell of respite in the landscape of Sussex, so Jarman’s brightly coloured shingle garden is a place where he can find peace.

15 Diaries can show people at their messiest \(even if they are intended for publication, as Jarman’s were\). At the best of times people are anxious, lonely, bitter, prejudiced, annoyed and confused. Encompassing all these feelings, diaries can be as expansive and gripping as fiction. They display the best and worst sides of their writers; they show readers that they are not alone in feeling scared or miserable. And reading the lives of others suggests that, even at times of crisis and distress, it is possible to find and grasp moments of joy. ■

## DAY 97America’s latest salvo against Huawei is aimed at chipmaking in China

### It may push the industry out of America, too

1 America has it in for Huawei—and not just because some of its politicians fear the Chinese giant’s networking gear lets spooks in Beijing eavesdrop on customers’ communications. The firm, a world leader in futuristic 5g telecoms, also symbolises China’s technological and economic ascent. President Donald Trump does not like it one bit. William Barr, his attorney-general, has warned that America risks “surrendering dominance” to China if it cannot “blunt Huawei’s drive” to 5g supremacy.

An earlier attempt at blunting, which made it illegal to sell American-made components to Huawei, including advanced computer chips on which the Chinese firm relies, was not the knock-out blow the White House hoped it to be. Chipmakers were able keep shipping Huawei semiconductors from factories outside America. So on May 15th the Trump administration extended its restrictions from chips to the tools used to make them—many of which come from America. So long as big microprocessor producers, like Taiwan Semiconductor Manufacturing Company \(tsmc\), use American-made equipment, they will no longer be able to forge Huawei-designed chips anywhere in the world.

2 In a press conference on May 18th a reticent Huawei said that the new rule put its survival at risk. Three days later President Xi Jinping vowed to invest $1.4trn by 2025 to increase China’s tech independence. Yet as with America’s original restrictions, the latest blast in the Sino-American chip war may not end up having the intended effect.

**3 Playing dirty in the clean room**

The new rule may miss its target entirely. Huawei pays contract manufacturers to assemble its phones and base stations. The chips that tsmc makes for Huawei are sent to those companies, not to the Chinese firm, for integration. Finished products are usually sent directly to Huawei’s customers. Huawei need not touch the blacklisted chips at any point. This may get Huawei off the hook. Some lawyers note that the new restriction does not seem to apply to items sent to third parties and not destined for Huawei, even where these are being supplied at Huawei’s direction.

4 Even if the legal experts are wrong, the rule will be difficult to enforce: the clean rooms of Asian chip foundries are hard to monitor. More important, the $412bn semiconductor industry is so globalised that even the long arm of American law will struggle to pin it down. The likelier upshot of the new export controls may be to drive a portion of America’s chipmaking industry from its shores.

5 The industry’s geographic scope was already becoming broader—and less American—over time. One crude yardstick for this is to track where its physical assets sit, as recorded in the filings of public tech businesses \(see chart\). The top dozen global semiconductor firms, for example, now have only 20% of their plant in America. Asian firms, such as tsmc, smic and Samsung, mostly locate their factories at home. American chipmakers, meanwhile, and many suppliers, have been diversifying geographically for years, says Dan Hutcheson of vlsi, a consultancy—partly in pursuit of cheap labour, partly to protect against natural disasters.

![&#x56FE;&#x7247;](https://uploader.shimo.im/f/50plpcBjhpksAoeK.png!thumbnail?fileGuid=rO0IT6giPfgqZSaA)

6 Consider Intel, which makes chips of its own design for customers \(among them Huawei\) that assemble electronic devices. In 2019 the American giant had over 35% of its $55bn in physical assets, a rough proxy for manufacturing capacity, abroad. Some $8bn-worth sat in Israel and another $4bn in Ireland. Industry insiders report that China-bound shipments from both places have increased since America’s Huawei-baiting began. Intel also has more than $5bn in assets in China, its biggest market. All told, $20bn of its $72bn in revenues last year came from China.

7 Another example is Analog Devices, a smaller American firm which makes radio-frequency chips on which Huawei relies heavily for the assembly of telecoms base stations. It, too, is spread around: half of its assets sit in the Philippines, Ireland, Singapore and Malaysia. Perhaps that might make it easier for the firm to explore the option of making its Huawei-bound chips in non-American facilities.

8 Geographic complexity has made it hard for America’s government to stop chipmakers’ kit from reaching Huawei. Hence the new focus on chipmaking tools, many of which are still made in America and so easier for Washington to control. Applied Materials, based in California, builds kit used to etch patterns into silicon, has 90% of its assets in the United States. Lam Research, an American maker equipment used by tsmc and others to process silicon wafers, has 88% of its $1.1bn plant at home.

One big unknown surrounding the new Huawei rule—which the chip industry’s lawyers are busily unpacking—is whether, under it, equipment manufactured at American firms’ overseas facilities counts as “American”. If so, advanced chipmaking factories that rely on such kit to fabricate cutting-edge chips for Huawei, as tsmc does, will need alternative suppliers. The American toolmakers’ Japanese rivals, such as Tokyo Electron and Hitachi High-Technologies, suddenly find themselves with a new geopolitical competitive edge.

9 Another mystery relates to an announcement made just as the new American measures against Huawei were being unveiled. On May 15th tsmc confirmed it would build a $12bn chip factory in Arizona, to be up and running by 2024. Why would the Taiwanese firm, which gets 15% of its revenue from Huawei, agree to pour billions into America just as its new host in effect deprived it of a big customer? It may be currying favour with the administration, hoping to avert sanctions against more Chinese customers. Observers point to another possibility. tsmc could equip the Arizona foundry with American gear from its existing factories, freeing space in its Taiwanese operations for brand new non-American kit that can freely serve Chinese customers. tmsc did not respond to a request for comment.

10 Even if that is not tsmc’s intention, workarounds are bound to proliferate. On May 18th the boss of Samsung Electronics toured his company’s new chip factory in Xian, a city in central China. The South Korean firm, which plans to invest $115bn in its chipmaking business over the next decade, has made it clear that it will not ignore China. America’s export controls may prompt it to kit out its foundries with equipment that will not fall foul of Sino-American geopolitics.

11 Chip-industry insiders report that semiconductor equipment is already being marketed inside China as “ear free”—meaning Chinese buyers need not worry about the “export administration regulations” that the Trump administration is using to attack Huawei. A person close to American toolmakers says some of them are thinking about moving their patents abroad to rebuild operations from scratch away from America’s jurisdiction, in order to circumvent present and future anti-Chinese restrictions. Mr Trump’s attempt to de-Sinify the semiconductor industry may do more to de-Americanise it instead.

## \# DAY 96“No Filter” chronicles the rise of Instagram

### Sarah Frier, a reporter for Bloomberg, also offers glimpses of Silicon Valley’s weirdness

1 On a beachside walk in Mexico in 2010, Kevin Systrom’s girlfriend explained the problem with his new photo-sharing app, then called “Codename”. Professionals might want the world to see their pictures, but her own phone snaps weren’t good enough. Back at the hotel, Mr Systrom coded a quick solution: a filter that gave even the most basic shot a hipster finish. He applied it to a snap of a dog by a taco stand, and uploaded it, making it the first image posted to what became Instagram.

2 A billion users later, the look in that filtered photo is ubiquitous. Square proportions, high contrast and darkened edges have instantly smartened up profile pictures, holiday albums and advertising campaigns around the world. In “No Filter” Sarah Frier, a technology correspondent at Bloomberg,uses close access to Instagram insiders to give a lively and revealing account of how the world came to see itself through Mr Systrom’s lens.

3 The tale of nerds who struck gold offers glimpses of Silicon Valley’s weirdness. In the early days Mr Systrom and his co-founder, Mike Krieger, patched errors with their laptops on camping trips and took a call from Justin Bieber when he forgot his password. Later, haggling over Instagram’s sale to Facebook, a crunch negotiation took place over a barbecue at Mark Zuckerberg’s mansion, with the Facebook founder grilling meat he boasted of shooting himself, though he was unsure if it was venison or boar. Mr Systrom went to the Vatican to persuade the ultimate influencer to sign up—and @franciscus obliged.

4 The sale, for a then-unthinkable $1bn, went sour. At Facebook “every single activity…stemmed from a religious obsession with growth,” writes Ms Frier, who is even-handed but seems closer to Instagram’s founders than Facebook’s high command. As its new owner steered Instagram towards taking ads and making money, some early employees, who had wanted to build “a community centred around the appreciation of art and creativity...instead felt that they had built a mall”. Mr Systrom, a perfectionist who initially oversaw every ad carried on Instagram, personally editing one to make the French fries look crispier, was seen by Facebookers as a precious snob.

5 As Instagram grew bigger and cooler, Facebook began to act “like the big sister that wants to dress you up for the party but does not want you to be prettier than she is”, complains one Instagram executive. Mr Zuckerberg limited how many people Instagram could hire. He even got cross that its new video app, igtv, had a logo that looked a bit like that of Facebook Messenger. In 2018, after six years of this, Mr Systrom and Mr Krieger quit.

6 Within this business story are several subplots. One is how Instagram blurred the lines between the personal and the promotional. Snoop Dogg, a rapper, made what may have been the first paid Instagram post in January 2011, when he uploaded a picture of himself “Bossin up wit dat Blast”, a new drink. At least before covid-19 struck, Kim Kardashian could make $1m from a single post to her 157m followers; over 200m users had 50,000 followers or more, enough to make a living as “human billboards”. America’s Federal Trade Commission has said influencers should declare when they are being paid. They often don’t.

7 Another subplot is how an app that people use to document their life turned into one that determines how they live it. At first this was a virtue. In the early days Instagram began encouraging wholesome outings to scenic spots for users to photograph. But it has become a problem. Some photogenic places, like Norway’s Trolltunga cliff, have been overrun. Worse, the ability to edit photos to perfection has spread insecurity. “I don’t know what real skin looks like any more,” complains Chrissy Teigen, an Instagram star.

8 All this brought in $20bn for Instagram in 2019, or a quarter of Facebook’s revenue. But perhaps encouragingly, some in the company have come to see perfectionism as a risk to Instagram’s business. Young people have embraced Snapchat and, more recently, TikTok, as networks where they can go unfiltered. There they can post even imperfect shots: of their ordinary selves, their ordinary lives, even an ordinary dog by a taco stand.

## DAY 95 The global food supply chain is passing a severe test

### Keeping the world fed

1 If you live in the rich world and want an example of trade and global co-operation, look no further than your dinner plate. As the lockdowns began in the West two months ago, many feared that bread, butter and beans would run short, causing a wave of stocking-up. Today, thanks to fleets of delivery lorries filling supermarket shelves, you can binge-eat as you binge-watch.

2 This capitalist miracle reflects not amonolithicplan, but an $8trn global supply chain adapting to a new reality, with millions of firms making spontaneous decisions, from switching rice suppliers in Asia to refitting freezers. The system is far from perfect: as incomes collapse, more people are going hungry. There are risks, from labour shortages to bad harvests. And there is an irony in seeing the industry grapple with a crisis that probably began with the sale of pangolin meat in a market in Wuhan. But the food network is so far passing a severe test. It is crucial that, during and after the pandemic, governments do not lurch into a misguided campaign for self-reliance.

3 The supply chains behind an iPhone, or a car component that criss-crosses the Rio Grande, are wonders of co-ordination. But the unsung star of 21st-century logistics is the global food system \(see[article](https://www.economist.com/briefing/2020/05/09/the-worlds-food-system-has-so-far-weathered-the-challenge-of-covid-19)\). From field to fork, it accounts for 10% of world gdp and employs perhaps 1.5bn people. The global supply of food has nearly tripled since 1970, as the population has doubled to 7.7bn. At the same time, the number of people who have too little to eat has fallen from 36% of the population to 11%, and a bushel of maize or cut of beef costs less today than 50 years ago in real terms. Food exports have grown sixfold over the past 30 years; four-fifths of people live in part on calories produced in another country.

This happens in spite of governments, not because of them.Although their role has declined, they still sometimes fix prices and control distribution. The European Union’s farm tariffs are four times those on its non-farm imports. A dozen or so big exporters, including America, India, Russia and Vietnam, dominate staples such as wheat and rice. Half a dozen trading firms, such as Cargill from Minnesota and cofco from Beijing, shift food around the world.

4 Concentration and government intervention, along with the vagaries of the climate and commodity markets, mean that the system is finely tuned and can misfire, with devastating consequences. In 2007-08 bad harvests and higher energy costs pushed up food prices. This led governments to panic about shortages and ban exports, causing more anxiety and even loftier prices. The result was a wave of riots and distress in the emerging world. It was the worst food crisis since the 1970s, when high fertiliser prices and bad weather in America, Canada and Russia caused food production to drop.

5 Despite the severity of today’s shock, each layer of the system has adapted. The supply of cereals has been maintained, helped by recent harvests and very high stocks. Shipping firms and ports continue to move around food in bulk. The shift from eating out has had dramatic consequences for some companies. McDonald’s sales have dropped by about 70% in Europe. The big retailers have cut their ranges and rewired their distribution.Amazon’s grocery e-commerce capacity has risen by 60%;Walmart has hired 150,000 people. Crucially, most governments have learned the lesson of 2007-08 and avoided protectionism. In terms of calories, only 5% of food exports face restrictions, as against 19% back then. So far this year prices have dropped.

6 But the test is not over yet. As the industry has globalised,it has grown more concentrated,creating bottlenecks. Covid-19 outbreaks at several American slaughterhouses have cut pork supplies by a quarter—and boosted wild-turkey hunting licences in Indiana by 28%. America and Europe will need over 1m migrant workers from Mexico, north Africa and eastern Europe to bring in the harvest. And as the economy shrinks and incomes collapse, the number of people facing acute food shortages could rise—from 1.7% of the world’s population to 3.4%, the un reckons, including in some rich countries. This reflects a shortage of money, not food, but if people go hungry governments will, understandably, take extraordinary measures. The ever-present risk is that rising poverty or production glitches will lead panicky politicians to stockpile food and limit exports. As in 2007-08, this could cause a tit-for-tat response that makes things worse.

7 Governments need to hold their nerve and keep the world’s food system open for business. That means letting produce cross borders, offering visas and health checks to migrant workers, and helping the poor by giving them cash, not stockpiling. It also means guarding against further industry concentration which could grow, if weaker food firms go bust or are bought by bigger ones. And it means making the system more transparent, traceable and accountable—with, for example, certification and quality standards—so that diseases are less likely to jump undetected from animal to human.

8 To understand food as a national-security issue is wise; to bend that understanding to self-sufficiency drives and blunt intervention is not. Already, before this year, food had become part of a trade war. America has sought to manage its soyabean exports and put tariffs on cheese. President Donald Trump has designated abattoirs part of America’s critical infrastructure. President Emmanuel Macron has called for Europe to build up its “strategic autonomy” in agriculture. Yet food autarky is a delusion. Interdependence and diversity make you more secure.

**Cooking up a new recipe**

9 The work of the food-supply system is not yet done. In the next 30 years supply needs to rise by about 50% to meet the needs of a wealthier, growing population, even as the system’s carbon footprint needs at least to halve. A new productivity revolution is required, involving everything from high-tech greenhouses near cities to fruit-picking robots. That is going to require all the agility and ingenuity that markets can muster, and huge sums of private capital. This evening, when you pick up your chopsticks or your knife and fork, remember both those who are hungry and also the system feeding the world. It should be left free to work its magic not just during the pandemic, but after it, too.■

## Day 94Even before lockdowns, confinement was part of human life

### And in some cases it was sought out

1 Very gradually, now here, now there, the rules that have kept a large share of the world’s peopleimmuredin their homes are being relaxed. There can be no sudden burst from confinement, like youngcoltsin spring.But already the parties are being planned, the long drives to see relations, the sheer revelling in independence and unfettered life.This peculiar imprisonment will end, and most people—physically, at least—will be free.

2 Yet, in myriad ways, confinement will continue as it always does. Alarms ring at the start of the day, and watches are strapped on, to submit to the limits of time. Bodies are roped with belts and ties, forced into unkind shoes and crammed into the narrow bounds of buses and tubes. Children, brushed and tidied, are packed off to school. And this, of course, is the daily round that many have been pining for.

It gets no looser as the day goes on. Office workers stay in one room, or one smallcubicle, completing set tasks. From the window they may envy the gardeners and builders round about. But the outside labourer still works within the limits of his ground, to the limits of tools and strength, within the unpredictableimperativesof nature. And as workers and non-workers alikesnuggle intothe comfortable confines of their beds, sleep wraps them closely round a second time.

3 Confinement, of all kinds and degrees, is part of human life. The word does not normally denote imprisonment, still less isolation, but the setting of limits. Those limits are often self-imposed or set by generally benevolent forces: parents, society. Confinement to the home and thereabouts by state order is rare, but in emergency that too has been, by and large, accepted.

4 Physical restriction, after all, starts early, with the full-termfetuscurled in a space it fills completely. Thispresumablyseems cosy to some, intolerable to others; attitudes to confinement may well be laid down_in utero_. Newborn infants, when asleep, will sometimesfling outtheir arms as if to check that the limits are still there, and to seek reassurance. And for long centuries, persisting to the present in places, this reassurance was partly provided byswaddlingthe child in linen bands as tightly as could be.

The purpose of swaddling was also to make the limbs grow straight, as saplings are braced and tied; and here the moral purpose of confinement enters the picture. As the limbs were straightened by the bands, so the mind of the growing child was straightened by careful instruction in discipline and manners.Rote-learningof noundeclensionsand multiplication tables kept the brain focused in a tunnel of repeated sounds. Beatings for forgetting, anddeferentialbehaviour to superiors, kept the body in check. Confinement instarchedclothes in a churchpew, or inmosqueorsynagogue, for long hours of theSabbathensured community cohesion. When young men and women subsequently went off the rails, as many did, they had plainly not been confined enough.

5 Much of that sort of restriction has disappeared from modern life. It is no longer bearable, though echoes of it have resurfaced in current public-information campaigns: the repeatedmantrasabout hand-washing, the threat of tighter rules for disobedience. But attitudes to confinement are not merely a matter of prevalent social norms. They also lie in the mind and mood of the beholder.

**6 Down the ages, fear of confinement was often\*\***inculcated**\*\*through stories**

For Hamlet in his half-madness, the world itself comprised “many confines, / wards, anddungeons, Denmark being one o’ the worst.” It was an “unweeded garden” \(gardens beinghedgedand walled, as even Eden had been enclosed\), possessed by “rank and gross” things. The Romantic poets tended to agree. Percy Bysshe Shelley thought himself confined by the entire institutional structure of his age, especially theinterdictionof free love; “heart-withering custom’s cold control” was a dead hand that he could not escape.Both Samuel Taylor Coleridge and John Keats felt “pent” in London, though Samuel Johnson had equated the city with life itself, and they had its whole width to wander in.Like the caged birds that were bought to swing at tenement windows, poets too could not sing among shops and chimney stacks.

1. an oppressive or discouraging influence or factor

7 Down the ages, fear of confinement was often inculcated through stories. A large number of fairy tales featured maidens confined indoors: the Sleeping Beauty in a palace-room behind thick thorns, Rapunzel in a high tower. Princes rescued them, but there was usually no obvious sign that their confinement had ended. It was perhaps just the fate of women to be shut up, as in the Song of Solomon \(“A garden enclosed is my sister, my spouse”\) or in medievalnunneries, or in theharemsof the East; after all their inexplicable or forward behaviour, the ancients thought, was caused by the womb drifting in an unchecked way. The agony that may be hidden in such closed rooms is perhaps summed up by the old use of “confinement” as a euphemism for childbirth, when a pregnant woman disappeared into a female world full of secret rituals, desperation, pain and shame.

**8 This lime-tree bower my prison**

Yet even strict confinement was not necessarily fearful. It might offer, paradoxically, a means of escape. In Greek myth, some characters—Myrrha, who had slept with her father, or the Heliades, who had offended the sun god—were turned into trees as punishment. For others, however—the nymph Daphne, turned into a laurel tree as Apollo pursued her, or Syrinx, turned into a reed to frustrate Pan—that gradual spread over their soft skin ofgnarledbark or hard outer layer, that stiffening of their limbs, wasdeliverance. Restriction could mark the beginning of a different and, in some ways, freer life.

9 Many encountered this paradox. Within a few lines, world-hating Hamlet also averred that “I could be bounded in a nutshell, and count myself a king of infinite space.” While the body was held, the mind leaped outwards. Julian of Norwich, in confinement and in vision, saw a “little thing”, only the size of a hazelnut, in God’s hand, and was told it was“all that is made”.She was one of hundreds of anchorites in pre-Reformation England, most of them women, who had entered a confinement so permanent that the Office of the Dead was recited over them, and the door of their tiny cell was sealed. They were not isolated; people consulted them, and through a window food would be passed in, the chamber pot passed out. But they were bounded, as in that nutshell. In this locked place, salvation could be found and God encountered. Jesus himself had told his followers not to pray in public, but to “enter into thy closet, and…shut the door…and thy Father...shall reward thee openly.” For each monk, nun or hermit their cell was, and is, their spiritual touchstone. As Abba Moses, a Desert Father, said, “Sit in your cell, and your cell will teach you everything.”

All that is made

10 Another self-imposed confinement, for those of a platonic cast of mind, was that of the soul within the body. When souls lost their feathers, as Socrates explained in “Phaedrus”, they fell from the heavenly realms and, on reaching solid ground, took on the covering of mortality. In this double casing of Earth and body, they could experience beauty; on recognising it, they would feel their feathers growing again and recall their heavenly beginnings. Romantic poets treasured this notion of confinement awakening the soul; of seeing, through thesmallest earthly forms,“into the life of things”. For Wordsworth, in his “Ode on Intimations of Immortality”, the soul’s visions could be unlocked even by the sight of a wildpansyin the grass.

11 They could be set free, too, when he lay on his couch in the small, dark rooms of Dove Cottage, where the views from the tiny windows were only of banks and close stone walls. Writers and thinkers in all disciplines have long found confinement useful, even essential. It can be technical: strict adherence to harmony and counterpoint, or to metre and rhyme. As Wordsworth himself explained, just as nuns were content with their narrow rooms, and hermits with their cells, he too for a while enjoyed “the sonnet’s scanty plot of ground”. More often, however, confinement is simply physical. Its purpose is focus, away from distraction. Virginia Woolf believed that women could never flourish as writers unless they had not only “money enough to travel and to idle”, but also independence of mind and spirit, in a room of their own.

虽然华兹华斯蜗居在鸽子农舍（华故居）里黑暗狭小的房间中，虽然他只是瘫在小屋里的沙发上，灵魂的飞溢仍然自由无束。虽然设若使视线穿过农舍的狭小窗扉，所见只有河岸同旁近的石头院墙而已。经久以来，钻研任何学科的写作者和思想家都笃信“闭关”是有所裨益的，甚而是一定不可或缺的。它可以成为一种精妙严格的技巧：一种和谐庄正的音乐，一种工整对仗的诗歌。华兹华斯自己则是这样解释的：正如修女满足于局促的帏幄，隐者欣喜于褊狭的寓所一样，他也长久地耽溺于“十四行诗的逼仄天地之中”。虽然在更多的时候，囚牢仅仅加诸于肉体之上，以此聚精会神、排除旁骛。弗吉尼亚·伍尔芙（英国近代女作家和文学理论家）则认为，女性作家如果期望成就一番名声，一定要“有闲钱去旅行和流浪”，并且在自我的一方小小世界中保持独立的精神和思想。

The rooms, or cells, or sheds, need not beaustereorviewless. Dylan Thomas’s writing shed at Laugharne had a prospect so beautiful, looking over “full-tilt river and switchback sea/Where the cormorants scud”, that it could not help appearing sometimes in his poems. Yet the lands he travelled were interior. Rainer Maria Rilke felt that his retreat at Muzot, a small square tower in the Alpine foothills, held the secrets of his poems; for it was there that he could mine his inner life, immersing himself in “inwardness”.

不管身居何种寓所，狭室或屋棚，自然不必苛求陋室寒舍或恶水穷山。狄兰·托马斯（英国近代作家、诗人）常在拉夫尔一处风景极美的处所进行写作，他俯瞰着“河湍倾泄、洋流急洄/此处鸬鹚翱翔”，喜不自胜、而留念于诗文——虽然他旅行的足迹其实从未抵达海洋。赖内·马利亚·里尔克（奥地利诗人）隐居在阿尔卑斯山麓的穆佐特的一座小方塔中，他相信此处保守着他的诗篇的秘密——因为正是在此处，他才能挖掘自己的生命内里，沉浸于精神灵性之中。

12 Physical feats of exploration, too, often rely on confinement. To stumble on the wonders of limestone formations underground, potholers must squeeze through tunnels and bores that can barely admit them. In the deep ocean, where a diver can no longer swim freely because of the weight of water above, two scientists and a pilot cram into a cabin six feet across in a tiny sphere of titanium, the deep-diving submersible_DSV Alvin_, as it drops two miles or so into the dark.

13 A dive on_Alvin_could last no longer than nine hours. But Al Worden, an astronaut on Apollo 15, spent 67 hours in lunar orbit in a command-module cabin with 6.17 cubic metres of space, while his two colleagues walked on the Moon. Other things confined him too: his clumsy space suit, and the minute-by-minute schedule imposed by mission control. In the simple poems he wrote afterwards \(for he felt that the official debriefing only scratched the surface\), the narrowness of his circumstances never rated a mention. He noticed only how unconfined he was, among thepirouettingstars, gazing at the “cloudy frail earth”, on which all the colours of the universe seemed to be focused:

> ### Teachable moment
>
> 1 Lockdown has delivered a nasty shock to academia, with universities around the world closing for the summer term, disrupting the plans of millions of students. Business schools are suffering along with the rest, but the shutdown has occurred when the sector is already facing a host of problems. A survey of the deans of American business schools by Eduvantis, a consultancy, found that almost all thought the pandemic would lead to permanent closures.

2 Bartleby contacted seven leading schools in America, Britain and France to see how they were coping with the crisis. Unsurprisingly, the immediate reaction has been to switch to teaching online. Many are putting a brave face on the issue. Christoph Loch, dean of the Judge school at Cambridge, says: “If we do this right, if we do it strategically, this is going to stay beyond covid.” Meanwhile the insead school in France maintains that it is hard to imagine going back to a world where the successes from online learning will not be combined with person-to-person exchanges.

3 The pandemic also presents a teaching opportunity. The Wharton School at the University of Pennsylvania has launched a course called “Epidemics, Natural Disasters and Geopolitics: Managing Global Business and Financial Uncertainty”. The London Business School will shortly run a course on “The Economics of a Pandemic”.

4 Online courses are all very well. But part of the motivation for attending business school is to take advantage of networking opportunities that could last for the rest of students’ careers. Some of this can be done online. At the mit Sloan School of Management, virtual student networking has included trivia nights, hackathons and a programming boot camp. In keeping with its location, activities at the Haas School in Berkeley, California, have included remote yoga and mindfulness classes. At insead, students gather in virtual break-out rooms for further discussions, with the groups picked at random to ensure interaction with a broader group of classmates.

5 Nevertheless, just as a friend you made on Facebook is not the same as someone you grew up with, virtual ties are unlikely to be as strong as normal ones. That has led to some dissatisfaction among students. At Wharton, more than 1,000 mba students have signed an online petition arguing that the school should reduce fees, which run to $150,000 for a two-year course. The petition claims that virtual-classroom technology is “unable to fully replicate” the usual teaching environment, and that other elements of the course, such as foreign travel and extra-curricular activities, “have been essentially cancelled”.

6 The rapid economic downturn caused by the pandemic is a complicating factor. In the past, business schools have benefited from recessions, as young people have chosen to continue their education rather than risk entering a shaky jobs market. But this time could be different.

7 First, it is not yet clear when business schools can reopen for traditional teaching. None of the schools had a firm timetable for that to happen. And candidates may wait until they do, rather than pay top dollar for an online course. Another survey, by Poets&Quants, a website for news about business schools, found that 43% of prospective mba students thought that fees should be lowered, and that a third might defer their courses until normal teaching can resume.

8 Second, the pandemic is likely further to discourage students from applying to business schools abroad. Around half of all American business schools experienced a decline in overseas applications last year, thanks to anti-immigration political rhetoric and the greater difficulty in getting visas to work once a degree was obtained.

9 Neither America nor Britain has covered itself in glory in recent weeks. A survey of international students by idp Connect found that, among Anglophone countries, Britain and America ranked behind New Zealand, Canada and Australia in terms of how they have handled the pandemic. The war of words between America and China over the virus will also have an effect. Students from the People’s Republic may be more inclined to study in their own country.

10 That is bad news for both universities and business schools, as international students are very lucrative. Things may go back to normal in a few years’ time; the virus may be conquered and international relations may settle down. But as with many other sectors of the economy, there may be a big shakeout among business schools before that happens.

## \# DAY 92Why the pandemic could eventually lower inequality

### History suggests it could precipitate shifts towards a more equal income distribution

1For america’s poor, the covid-19 pandemic has delivered a swift and brutal reversal of fortune.At the start of the year unemployment was plumbing new lows. Years of wage growth for low-income workers had healed some of the scars left by the global financial crisis. Already by 2016, the most recent year for which figures are available, the economic expansion had produced a smaller rise in American income inequality, after taxes and transfers, than any expansion since the early 1980s. Between 2016 and 2019 the weekly earnings of low- and middle-income workers grew at an annual average pace of 3.8%. Since covid-19 struck, however, a host of economic statistics—and legions of pundits—have pointed to a resurgence in inequality. Yet if history is a guide, the pandemic could eventually render the distribution of income more egalitarian.

2 There are many reasons why the well-heeled might suffer less in the pandemic. Much of the plunge in asset prices that occurred in March has since been retraced. In places like New York City and Los Angeles, covid-19 seems to have hit poorer neighbourhoods harder. Low-wage earners are often less able to work from home or maintain social distancing. Interruptions to schooling widen the gaps in achievement between children from richer backgrounds and those from poorer families.

3 Meanwhile, workers on the lower rungs of the income ladder have borne the brunt of job losses. America’s unemployment rate rose by roughly ten percentage points, to 14.7%, in April—the highest since the Depression. The jobless rate for workers with a college education went up by nearly six percentage points, to 8.4%; that for workers without a high-school diploma leapt by just over 14 percentage points, to 21.2%. A new paper published by the Becker Friedman Institute at the University of Chicago reinforces the point. Between February and April,find its authors, employment among workers in the top fifth of the income distribution dropped by 9%. In the bottom fifth, by contrast, it plunged by 35%.

4 Were the crisis of unemployment to end as swiftly as it began, the effects of these uneven job losses on inequality would be limited, and fleeting. Many jobless workers are earning more in unemployment benefits than they did on the job, thanks to a top-up of $600 per week enacted by Congress in March. Of the more than 20m Americans who were out of work in April, 78% were reported to be temporarily laid off. But the danger is that temporary job losses become permanent. The authors of the Becker Friedman paper calculate that active employment—or the number of workers counted on payrolls—declined by 14% between February and April. About 40% of that fall occurred at firms that had ceased operations,at least temporarily. Not all will reopen. A new working paper by Jose Maria Barrero of Instituto Tecnológico Autónomo de México, Nicholas Bloom of Stanford University and Steven Davis of the University of Chicago is similarly gloomy, concluding that 42% of pandemic-related job losses will be permanent. Meanwhile, the crush of claimants has overwhelmed some state governments and slowed the flow of unemployment aid. Top-up benefits are due to expire in July, when millions will still be jobless.

5 The most vulnerable workers are therefore likely to be squeezed hard by the recession. But if history is a guide, those at the top of the income distribution could yet face a reckoning. Disruptive global events have often precipitated shifts towards a more equal distribution of income and wealth. In his influential book, “Capital in the Twenty-First Century”, Thomas Piketty points out that high levels of inequality in the late 19th and early 20th centuries were reduced by the calamitous events of the period from 1914 to 1945. In that time the share of income earned by America’s top 1%, for instance, dropped from 19% to 14%. The combination of depression, war, inflation and taxes compressed incomes and laid waste to vast fortunes. Walter Scheidel, a historian, goes further still in his book on long-run inequality, “The Great Leveller”. Since antiquity, he argues, only four forces have ever managed to reduce inequality in a sustained way: war, revolution, state failure and pandemic. \(The troubles often coincide: a pandemic contributed to the failure of the Roman empire; another coincided with the end of the first world war.\)

6 Past crises are a far cry from today’s difficulties. The Black Death compressed income gaps by dramatically reducing the ratio of workers to arable land. Even in the worst possible case, covid-19 will kill far fewer than the 30-60% of Europeans felled by bubonic plague. Stockmarkets could plunge again, but it is very unlikely that they will match the collapse of nearly 90% that took place between 1929 and 1932. Yet some comparisons can still be made. The debts racked up by governments during this pandemic will in some cases reach heights last seen during the world wars. When governments eventually balance the books—and especially if they reduce debt burdens via taxation, financial repression or debt restructuring—the wealthy could find themselves footing the bill.

**Time for a redeal**

7 Furthermore, the crisis could have indirect effects that influence the trajectory of inequality. In a critique of Mr Piketty’s arguments published in 2017 Marshall Steinbaum, now of the University of Utah, argued that the wars and the Depression of the 20th century mainly led to greater egalitarianism by discrediting ruling elites and the regressive policies that had enabled the rises in inequality in the first place. That created space for social democracy to bloom. Inequality fell not only because of higher taxes but also because of extensions to the welfare state.

8 History need not repeat itself. Governments and economic systems of all kinds have struggled to manage the pandemic effectively and equitably. But it does not take much imagination to see that if politicians allow the costs of the pandemic to be borne unequally they could sow the seeds of a transformativepopulist backlash. They would do well to heed the lessons of the past.

## \# DAY 91Eavan Boland died on April 27th

### The Irish poet who recovered and championed women’s voices was 75

1 When summer nights were warm, Eavan Boland liked to stand in the front doorway of her small suburban house in Dundrum, outside Dublin. She would look at thebuddleia, and at the lamplightglossingthe leaves of thehedge. Yet these things were not simply visible to her. She saw them with her body. It was as if she was part of some great continuum, or stood in a place of myth, like the women singers she imagined in the hard west of Ireland whose mouths were filled with“Atlantic storms and clouded-over stars/and exhausted birds”.

![&#x56FE;&#x7247;](https://uploader.shimo.im/f/BaPj9AGYaD4bsZXC.png!thumbnail?fileGuid=rO0IT6giPfgqZSaA)

2 This sense of communality, which led her to be one of Ireland’s finest poets, was essentially a woman’s feeling. And it was missing almost entirely from Irish poetry. There the voice was male, bardic, authoritative,grown sweetand self-confident on the flattery of princes.It was “I”, not “we”.The poet was a hero, a seer, a towering figure \(Yeats above all\), whose themes were history, epic and elegy. This was not a world for women. When they featured in the work they were mostly objectified, passive and silent. No page recorded“the low music/of our outrage”.Their own poems were not encouraged, as if they were women’s-magazine things that woulddefilethe pure, visionary flow. If she were to write in the men’s style, with their assurance, she would fit right in, as she fitted into the clever literary conversations in the pubs round St Stephen’s Green when she was at Trinity College. But once she was married and the mother of two small daughters, happy if she couldjot downjust one line or one image,that was not her life.

![&#x56FE;&#x7247;](https://uploader.shimo.im/f/PL6ovI7KKd2oHhun.png!thumbnail?fileGuid=rO0IT6giPfgqZSaA)

3 Her days nowrevolved roundcooking, washing up, nappies, feeds; lifting the kettle to the gas stove, setting her skirt over a chair to have it without creases for the morning. They were full of small untidinesses and oversights which assumed huge importance, like the loaf forgotten by the cash register, or washing left wet. They were full, too, of hidden satisfactions: a row of cupswinkingon theirsaucers, a copper pan well polished, fresh green celery feathers. Much of this was so ordinary that it might have seemed unremarkable. Certainly it was not named in Irish poetry. But ordinariness, “dailiness”, was precisely what she wanted to capture. The surfaces of things could barely hold what was under them; just as the small, routine gestures of many couples contained the unspoken steadfastness of love.

4 Other “women’s subjects” needed tackling more forcefully. She had noqualmsabout that. The whole poetic tradition had to bescrubbedandabradedwith the wash stones of resistance. So an anorexic torched her witch-body, its “curves and paps” until, “thin as a rib”,she could slip back into Adam again, “as if I had never been away”.A menstruating woman confronted the moon, “dulled by it/thick with it…a watercauledby her light…barrenwith her blood.” Shockingly, a wife who believed “I was not myself, myself” in her everyday dutifulness felt herself remade when her husband, coming home tight, split her lip and knuckled her neck “to its proper angle”; and was grateful for his remodelling.

5 Yet the all-too-ordinary often slipped into something else.She was too deeply read in the myths and epics of Ireland for it to be otherwise.The life that was lived in a brick house could still have a visionary quality. In “Night Feed”, she noticed not only the rosy zipped sleeper, the hard suckling, the silt of milk left in the bottle, but the movements of earth and stars, and the “long fall from grace” as the feed ended. The stopping of the tumble-dryer, like death, began “to bury/The room in white spaces.” An old florin, brushed on a shelf, turned into a silver salmon.

6 That everyday life was also not remote from history. But she preferred to call it The Past: a place of shadows, fragments, defeats, rather than heroics. The Troubles appeared, through an ancient television set, as “grey and greyer tears” and “moonlight-coloured funerals”. Emigration to America was a woman in a gansy-coat on the deck of the_Mary Belle_, holding her half-dead baby to her. In “Quarantine” the worst year of thefamine, 1847, was encapsulated in a couple found frozen, he still carrying her, holding her feet against his breastbone to try to warm them. Just two people’s deaths, how they had lived, what they had suffered,

> _And what there is between a man and woman._ _And in which darkness it can best be proved._ 7 Such themes were inevitable, for her discovery of her woman’s voice in poetry was meshed to her discovery of Ireland. She had left that home at the age of six, when her diplomat father was posted to London and then New York. When at 14 she returned, she did not know the secret language of the country, especially of Dublin, which she grew to love. As a woman she saluted “Anna Liffey” as the river rose in the hills above her house, flowing through black peat and bracken, then claiming and “retelling” the city for her, putting the pieces together, as she went on trying to.

8 Ireland, though, could still disappoint her. In 1991, when the monumental Field Day Anthology of Irish Writing came out, she was one of only three contemporary women poets included. Furious, she fired up her campaign for women to be noticed and, through poetry workshops,for poetry to beextended to all who had no voices. After 1996 a professorship at Stanford, alternating with trips home, allowed her to check on progress from abroad. By the 21st century, to her delight, women poets were flourishing in Ireland, and two new Field Day volumes were devoted to women’s writing. Though she never liked to take credit, she had been a voice and a constant encouragement; she had changed the conversation.

> > 1 Even before the pandemic, globalisation was in trouble. The open system of trade that had dominated the world economy for decades had been damaged by the financial crash and the Sino-American trade war. Now it is reeling from its third body-blow in a dozen years as lockdowns have sealed borders and disrupted commerce \(see[Briefing](https://www.economist.com/briefing/2020/05/14/covid-19s-blow-to-world-trade-is-a-heavy-one)\). The number of passengers at Heathrow has dropped by 97% year-on-year; Mexican car exports fell by 90% in April; 21% of transpacific container-sailings in May have been cancelled. Aseconomies reopen, activity will recover, but don’t expect a quick return to a carefree world of unfettered movement and free trade. The pandemic will politicise travel and migration and entrench a bias towards self-reliance. This inward-looking lurch will enfeeble the recovery, leave the economy vulnerable andspreadgeopolitical instability.

2 The world has had several epochs of integration, but the trading system that emerged in the 1990s went further than ever before. China became the world’s factory and borders opened to people, goods, capital and information \(see[Chaguan](https://www.economist.com/china/2020/05/14/a-small-town-in-china-makes-half-of-japans-coffins)\). After Lehman Brothers collapsed in 2008 most banks and some multinational firms pulled back. Trade and foreign investment stagnated relative to gdp, a process this newspaper later called slowbalisation. Then came President Donald Trump’s trade wars, which mixed worries about blue-collar jobs and China’s autocratic capitalism with a broader agenda of chauvinism and contempt for alliances. At the moment when the virus first started to spread in Wuhan last year, America’s tariff rate on imports was back to its highest level since 1993 and both America and China had begun to decouple their technology industries.

3 Since January a new wave of disruption has spread westward from Asia. Factory, shop and office closures have caused demand to tumble and prevented suppliers from reaching customers. The damage is not universal. Food is still getting through, Apple insists it can still make iPhones and China’s exports have held up so far, buoyed by sales of medical gear. But the overall effect is savage. World goods trade may shrink by 10-30% this year. In the first ten days of May exports from South Korea, a trade powerhouse, fell by 46% year-on-year, probably the worst decline since records began in 1967.

4 The underlying anarchy of global governance is being exposed. France and Britain have squabbled over quarantine rules, China is threatening Australia with punitive tariffs for demanding an investigation into the virus’s origins and the White House remains on the warpath about trade. Despite some instances of co-operation during the pandemic, such as the Federal Reserve’s loans to other central banks, America has been reluctant to act as the world’s leader. Chaos and division at home have damaged its prestige. China’s secrecy and bullying have confirmed that it is unwilling—and unfit—to pick up the mantle. Around the world, public opinion is shifting away from globalisation. People have been disturbed to find that their health depends on a brawl to import protective equipment and on the migrant workers who work in care homes and harvest crops.

5 This is just the start. Although the flow of information is largely free outside China, the movement of people, goods and capital is not. Consider people first. The Trump administration is proposing to curtail immigration further, arguing that jobs should go to Americans instead. Other countries are likely to follow. Travel is restricted, limiting the scope to find work, inspect plants and drum up orders. Some 90% of people live in countries with largely closed borders. Many governments will open up only to countries with similar health protocols: one such “travel bubble” is mooted to include Australia and New Zealand and, perhaps, Taiwan and Singapore \(see[article](https://www.economist.com/finance-and-economics/2020/05/14/could-travel-bubbles-offer-a-route-to-economic-recovery)\). The industry is signalling that the disruption to travel will be lasting. Airbus has cut production by a third and Emirates, a symbol of globalisation, expects no recovery until 2022.

6 Trade will suffer as countries abandon the idea that firms and goods are treated equally regardless of where they come from. Governments and central banks are asking taxpayers to underwrite national firms through their stimulus packages, creating a huge and ongoing incentive to favour them. And the push to bring supply chains back home in the name of resilience is accelerating. On May 12th Narendra Modi, India’s prime minister, told the nation that a new era of economic self-reliance has begun. Japan’s covid-19 stimulus includes subsidies for firms that repatriate factories; European Union officials talk of “strategic autonomy” and are creating a fund to buy stakes in firms. America is urging Intel to build plants at home. Digital trade is thriving but its scale is still modest. The sales abroad of Amazon, Apple, Facebook and Microsoft are equivalent to just 1.3% of world exports.

7 The flow of capital is also suffering, as long-term investment sinks. Chinese venture-capital investment in America dropped to $400m in the first quarter of this year, 60% below its level two years ago. Multinational firms may cut their cross-border investment by a third this year. America has just instructed its main federal pension fund to stop buying Chinese shares, and so far this year countries representing 59% of world gdp have tightened their rules on foreign investment. As governments try to pay down their new debts by taxing firms and investors, some countries may be tempted to further restrict the flow of capital across borders.

**It’s lonely out there**

8 Don’t be fooled that a trading system with an unstable web of national controls will be more humane or safer. Poorer countries will find it harder to catch up and, in the rich world, life will be more expensive and less free. The way to make supply chains more resilient is not to domesticate them, which concentrates risk and forfeits economies of scale, but to diversify them. Moreover, a fractured world will make solving global problems harder, including finding a vaccine and securing an economic recovery.

9 Tragically, this logic is no longer fashionable. Those three body-blows have so wounded the open system of trade that the powerful arguments in its favour are being neglected. Wave goodbye to the greatest era of globalisation—and worry about what is going to take itsplace.■

## DAY 89Two leading economists disagree about the flagging American Dream

1 Most americans worry that they live in an age of reduced social mobility. Raj Chetty, a Harvard economist, has done as much as anyone to provideempirical heft for that malaise.Armed with data from nearly all thetaxreturnsfiled in America for decades, he and his co-authors have pieced together an astonishing series of findings: that absolute mobility \(the chance that a child will go on to earn more than their parents\) has dropped from 90%, a near certainty, to 50%, acoin-toss; that the gap in life-expectancy between rich and poor has widened even as that between blacks and whites has narrowed; and that although the chances of upward mobility differ greatly from one neighbourhood to the next, in nearly every part of America the path for black boys is steeper.

2 Mr Chetty has also compiled evidence that mobility \(or immobility\) depends a lot on the types of neighbourhood that Americans grow up in. Re-analysing the Moving to Opportunity \(mto\) experiment, which randomly assigned vouchers to poor families in five American cities to live in less poor places, he and his colleagues found dramatic effects for children who moved while young: a 32% higher chance of attending college and 31% higher earnings. His researchconsortiumhas ranked neighbourhoods according to their chances of propelling poor children upwards, publishing an online OpportunityAtlas. A new mto-style experiment in Seattle is investigating these dynamics in real time.

3 “It’s like Rousseau \[in ‘The Social Contract’\]: ‘Man is born free and everywhere he is in chains.’ We just remove the chain of neighbourhood. And it’s not that simple,” says James Heckman, an economist at the University of Chicago, who has grown critical of the research and the implications drawn from it. Mr Heckman, who won a Nobel prize for work on teasing out cause and effect from messy, real-world data, thinks there is more statistical uncertainty in the neighbourhood-mobility findings than is widely recognised. A working paper by Magne Mogstad, another economist at the University of Chicago, and his colleagues argues that the “noise”, or random fluctuation, in Mr Chetty’s data means “it is not possible to draw firm conclusions about which counties in the United States have high or low values” of upward mobility from the poorest 25% of households.

4 Mr Heckman acknowledges that there are clear differences in mobility according to neighbourhood. But the ultimate drivers could lie in family structure, parenting habits, exposure to crime or the quality of schooling. All these are difficult to derive from American tax-return data.

5 Pundits take the research on “neighbourhood effects” as evidence that “zipcode is destiny”. Mr Heckmanbristlesat that. It overlooks the fact that Asians and black women do fairly well in mobility relative to whites. “It diverts attention away from other plausible explanations for why African-Americans are not doing well. Put discrimination on the table…but family structure is the one thing that is just off the table in American society,” he says.

6 That topic has a history of descending into uglyspatsabout the personalculpabilityof the poor, which mayward offsocial scientists. Mr Heckman sees his own research—tracking long-term outcomes for children and parents randomly assigned to a high-quality early-learning scheme—as strong evidence that families can become more stable and that disadvantaged children can be helped without having to move. The point is not to yearn for a return to “shotgun marriages”, he says, but to encourage stablecohabitingrelationships.

7 This debate matters not just because two prominent economists disagree, but because they suggest different methods for tackling the urgent problem of intergenerational immobility. Mr Chetty’s experimental work on the primacy of place will be an important test of his theories, yet it also has a limit on its scale: every disadvantaged American plainly cannot be moved to opportunity. Mr Heckman’s project of encouraging early-childhood education has somescalingquestions, too: could every child in America receive a programme as intensive as the ones he studies? For now, the answer, as with all messy scientific debates, is to let the experiments proceed. ■

## \# DAY 88In China, covid-19 has focused attention on mental health

### In Mao’s day, sufferers were accused of lacking revolutionary zeal

1Late in january Shen Yinjing, a therapist in Shanghai, volunteered to help distressed people in the coronavirus-stricken city of Wuhan by offering counselling over the phone or by text. Before long she was running an online support group for people being treated in one of Wuhan’s makeshift hospitals for covid-19 patients. Now Ms Shen wonders how she should assist those bereaved by the disease. She worries that many people will not think to ask for help, even though the loss of a loved one can cause lasting mental trauma.

2 Ms Shen is among a small army of mental-health professionals who have provided support during the coronavirus outbreak, which reached a peak in China in January and February. Hundreds of universities and charities have set up “psychological hotlines” for people suffering from ailments such as anxiety and depression. Their efforts have enjoyed strong backing from the government, which has issued dozens of directives to guide the mental-health response to the epidemic.

3 Such attention reflects a profound change in official and public attitudes. Under Mao Zedong, modern approaches to psychology and psychiatry were suppressed. Mental ailments were treated as a deficiency of revolutionary zeal—nothing that earnest study of the chairman’s works couldn’t cure. In the post-Mao era political taboos surrounding mental health were lifted. But cultural ones persisted. Among citizens, psychological problems remained shrouded in shame. The government still paid little attention to developing expertise in the science. It tended to regard those with psychiatric disorders as potential troublemakers rather than as people in need of sympathetic care.

4 In recent years, however, the government has begun to stress the importance of mental health in the country’s long-term development goals. A mental-health law, passed in 2012, advised against the previously common practice of confining people in psychiatric wards against their will. The government’s “Healthy China 2030” plan, issued in 2016, called for a stronger “mental-health service system”.

5 These days many Chinese recognise that mental-health problems are common. Zhiying Ma of the University of Chicago says that young Chinese, in particular, have grown comfortable using terms such as depression and anxiety when talking about their difficulties. A Chinese government-funded survey published in 2019 found that such disorders were becoming more common in China. The study’s authors suggested that “rapid social change” was intensifying “psychological pressure and stress”.

6 At the same time, mental-health counselling has become more widely available, particularly for those willing to pay for private treatment. Between 2002 and 2018 more than 1m people completed brief government-certified courses in counselling skills. A devastating earthquake that struck the south-western province of Sichuan in 2008, killing more than 60,000 people, helped to promote interest in work involving psychology. In its wake, more Chinese took up careers as therapists.

7 Mental-health workers who have responded to the covid-19 outbreak appear better-organised and better-trained than the volunteers who flocked to care for victims of the earthquake, says Huang Hsuan-Ying of the Chinese University of Hong Kong. During the covid crisis, counsellors have formed online networks to co-ordinate their efforts to help the afflicted. Yu Zhihong, a professor of social work at Wuhan University, set up one such group. Its members provide psychological support for nearly 30 people who lost loved ones to the virus. Ms Yu says some of them are suffering from feelings of guilt, believing they were the source of a fatal infection, or worrying that they did not do enough to help a person who died.

8 But Ms Yu says that some people are reluctant to seek help from her network. She says this may be because grief is a private family matter in Chinese culture, and stigma still surrounds those who seek help from mental-health professionals.

9 There remain far too few such specialists to cope with China’s needs. The country has about two registered psychiatrists per 100,000 citizens, only about a sixth of the number in rich countries. Few Chinese have access to top-notch primary health care, so mild mental problems can go undetected until they are severe. Hospitals do not offer good care, either. Doctors often prescribe drugs, even when more subtle treatment, such as psychotherapy, might suffice. That is in part because they lack expertise and in part because it is more profitable to dispense pills.

10 The mental-health system that the government says it is building would make it easier for ordinary Chinese to receive counselling in local clinics or schools. The rich southern city of Shenzhen is one of about 30 places that were instructed in 2019 to pilot such reforms. By the end of this year it plans to have a staffed “psychological counselling room” in all of its larger local clinics. By the end of 2021 it aims to make counselling available in 85% of primary and secondary schools.

11 The reforms may help. But officials often refer to them not as a way of boosting public health, but as a means of improving “social governance”—in other words, strengthening control. It is possible that the counselling rooms will provide some assistance to people who are suffering, but also make it easier for the government to keep tabs on unhappy people.

12 Stories from Wuhan provide reasons to be sceptical. Grieving relatives report that they have been obliged to take government officials with them when they bury ashes, perhaps to ensure that funerals are kept brief and low key. Members of one family were ordered by police to delete an online group they had created in order to help bereaved people connect with each other. The government wants Chinese to talk more about their emotions, but not if they say the wrong things. ■

## DAY 87Don’t stand so close to me

### Office design may need to change

1 Office working and social distancing really do not mix. The reason why offices exist is to bring colleagues together so they can collaborate. So when employees start to return as pandemic-related restrictions are lifted, they will face a host of challenges.

2 Start with the basics: getting into the building. In most offices a lot of people tend to leave and arrive at the same time. Keeping them six feet \(two metres\) apart as they enter may require a queue in the street. Many workers will want to avoid public transport until the pandemic fades from memory, so may cycle to work. But even where offices have changing rooms, they tend to be fairlycramped; hard to keep employees apart.

Lifts are an even bigger choke-point. In normal circumstances people who work in high-rises are accustomed to a long wait to reach the top floors. If lifts can only carry two or three people at a time, that wait would lengthen. And imagine thehassleif a group of visitors arrives at once.

3 When workers make it to their desks, there is another problem. In recent years offices have been increasing density. The space per workstation in Britain decreased by around a quarter in the decade to 2018, according to Jon Neale of jll, a property consultancy. But social-distancing rules may drastically reduce the number of people offices can accommodate. Nick Jackson of Arup, an engineering and architectural group, says a two-metre space between desks in a central London office building may reduce the number of staff it can host to 30-35% of the pre-pandemic total.

4 In the short term, these problems have an obvious answer: let people work from home, or bring them into the office in shifts \(maybe two days a week\).This will limit serendipity but is better than nothing.The trickier question is whether office design will change in the longer run.

5 Some high-tech solutions floated before the pandemic appear newly relevant. Zaha Hadid Architects, a big British firm, has designed an eco-friendly building in Sharjah, a city in the United Arab Emirates, with “contactless pathways”, where employees rarely need to touch the building with their hands. Doors open automatically using motion sensors and facial recognition; lifts \(and even acuppa\) can be ordered from a smartphone.

6 Other ideas emerged in response to covid-19. Besides hand sanitiser at the entrance and touch-free doors, an office in Amsterdam designed by Cushman & Wakefield, a property-services group, has desks surrounded by a zone of colour-coded carpet to let people know when they are getting too close. At the start of the day workers pick up a paper deskpad on which to rest their laptop, and which is discarded when they leave. Arrows on the floor guide them to move around clockwise.

7 All very clever. You could even imagine it working—for a few weeks. But after a while the rules would surely be broken. Bert wants to talk to Ernie who is within sight and just a dozen feet away in an anticlockwise direction. Will he really take the long route around? And physical distance from colleagues is one thing. The potential for germs to be spread via communal items and surfaces is another. Think about the handle on the kettle or the controls of the photocopier. The much-loved snack cupboard at_The Economist_is probably doomed.

8 The new emphasis will be on cleanliness. Facilities managers will take a leaf from “The Restaurant at the End of the Universe”, a science-fiction novel by Douglas Adams, where the Golgafrinchans exiled telephone sanitisers and other useless people \(such as insurance salesmen and management consultants\) on a spaceship,only for their planet’s population to be wiped out by a virus contracted from a dirty handset.

Better air filtration to limit the spread of disease may bring other benefits. One study found that the extra costs of improving air quality could be paid back in less than two years, in terms of higher productivity and reduced ill health.

9 But not all improvements will be as cost-effective. The reason employees are crammed together is to cut rental expenses. One wonders whether, if a vaccine is found and social distancing no longer required, firms will consider office redesign isworth the candle.

10 Some elements, like more cleanliness, may stick. The pandemic will speed up the trend towards virtual meetings and home-working. Companies may try to lure highly skilled workers with more personal space, like first-class seats on an aeroplane. But the masses will still be crammed in economy.■

## DAY 86Ode to the shopping mall

### How palatial shops, threatened by the virus, shaped America

1 In almost all its modern crises, America has looked to its merchants for leadership. In 1914 John Wanamaker, the greatest retailer of the age, made headlines by dispatching 2,000 tons of food aid to Belgium—then suggesting America buy the little country to make the peace. In 1942 his New York rival, Macy’s, announced it was cancelling its annual Thanksgiving parade and donating 650 pounds of balloon rubber to the war effort: “We’ve enlisted!” Department stores, America’s temples of commerce, could always be relied upon to sell war bonds with panache. In a Younkers store in Des Moines, Iowa, a coffin for Adolf Hitler was lowered mechanically from the ceiling to the floor whenever a sale was made.

2 Masters of self-promotion, the great retailers did not suffer by being associated withpatriotism. Yet rather than deplore their opportunism, Americans celebrated the consumption it was designed to promote. During the Great Depression, they rallied to the retailers’ “Buy Now” campaigns. Shopping was not merely the surest way to boost the economy; it was urbanites’ main community activity. As recently as September 2001, President George W. Bush hinted at thatdualtruth when urging Americans to shrug off terrorism and hit the stores. By contrast, the current crisis is the first in over a century in which retailers have provided no comfort.

3 Online ones are thriving but unloved. The biggest, Amazon, is battling damaging headlines over itspatchyservice and treatment of workers. Traditional retailers are meanwhile looking into theabyss. This week J.Crew filed for bankruptcy. JCPenney, whose low-cost innovations helped it survive the Depression and proved inspirational to one of its employees, Sam Walton, founder of Walmart, is also struggling under a heavy debt load. Macy’s, America’s biggest department store by sales, lost its place in the s&p 500 last month while all its 775 stores were closed. It reopened 68 this week but expects them to do around 15% of their regular trade: more a death rattle than a recovery. By one estimate, over 300 department stores could go under by the end of next year.

4 Losing your custom overnight will do that. Yet bricks-and-mortar retailers were struggling long before the virus struck, against e-commerce and other stresses, including Donald Trump’s tariffs, which many decried. The president was never going to turn to them as Herbert Hoover did to his friend J.C. Penney in 1929.Yet a weary sense of inevitability about legacy retail’s demise should not obscure how traumatic a development it is.Many of America’s shuttered cities were shaped by department stores: they would not have developed as they did, or at all, without them. Nor would the consumer economy; nor elements of American democracy.

5 The emergence of palatial, multi-line stores in New York, Chicago and other big cities in the mid-19th century was a first-world phenomenon, pioneered in Europe. Yet merchants such as Wanamaker, who opened his first department store in Philadelphia in 1876, added American characteristics. Their stores tended to be bigger than European ones and packed with extravaganzas; Wanamaker’s flagship store boasted 2m square feet and the world’s biggest organ. America’s retailers also poured their huge profits into advertising, which shored up the free press. And they were more egalitarian than Europeans, especially to women, as both customers and employees. By 1918 42% of Macy’s buyers were women.

6 Many promoted their enterprises as morally improving. Wanamaker, who also formed the world’s biggest Sunday school, described his stores as “beautiful fields of necessities”. With steepling cast-iron structures and acres of plate-glass, flooding them with light, they were America’s answer to Europe’s cathedrals.

Such stores’ impact on cities surpassed even their footprints. They feminised and commercialised them. They fostered civic identity as well as consumerism. To be from Philly was to know and shop at Wanamaker’s. Thereby the great downtown stores became synonymous with the forces that had fuelled their growth, industrialisation, urbanisation, democratisation. To this day famous names such as Macy’s, which retains its giant flagship store in Herald Square, Manhattan, retain an exalted place in the culture: over 3m turn out to watch its annual parade.

7 This is despite the fact that most Macy’s and other department stores are now in the suburban malls that began mushrooming after the second world war. They are less loved. Where Hollywood invariably depicts downtown stores as places of innocence and Santa Claus, itportraysmalls asanonymousand prone to zombie attack. Those contrasting views are linked—the suburban expansion having devastated many cherished downtown areas. But the contrast is also unjust. Most Americans seem to associate malls with relaxation and family—a truth your columnist learned while staying on American bases in Afghanistan and Iraq. All the bigger ones had arudimentarymall, selling fast food, sportswear, cheap carpets andCelticswords, where the soldiers loved tosaunterand unwind. Even conventional malls build social capital in a way it is hard to imagine e-commerce ever could.

**8 Shop till you drop**

Moreover, following a period of intense competition in the 1980s, America’s malls have increasingly come to resemble the extravagant old emporia. New Jersey’s $5bn American Dream mall, which opened last October, has an indoor ski slope, Legoland and Ferris wheel. The Grove shopping centre in Los Angeles takes its homage to early retail even further. It is a mock-up of a 20th-century town centre, including a tram-line and Art Deco cinema.

9 Such enterprises aim to retain a place in American life even as face-to-face retail recedes from it. The developers of the American Dream mall aimed to let only 45% of their area to retailers before the pandemic—and have since slashed the figure to 30%. That would seem realistic. Except, what if the virus persuades a generation of Americans to stay at home for their entertainment, as well as their shopping? And what kind of America would that be?■

## DAY 85ASAP is more important than affirmative action

### Meet one of the least-known and most effective programmes to boost social mobility in America

1 Growing up in Morris Heights, a poor neighbourhood in the Bronx where violence was omnipresent, Joel Cabrera thought his future would be either “death or jail, because that’s what the outcomes are here”. Middle school was like “a juvenile-detention facility”. High school did not interest him enough to finish. Had he stopped there, he would have faced a life on the edge of penury. Among high-school dropouts nationwide, average earnings are only $600 a week. To avoid that, Mr Cabrera enrolled in courses offered at his local community college. There he came across a scheme called asap \(“Accelerated Study in Associate Programmes”\) that sought to push pupils like him—city residents without family wealth or familiarity with universities—to complete two-year degrees.

2 asap is designed to address a simply stated problem. Many low-income minority students enroll in college. But few finish. Only 34% of black men finish their bachelor’s degree within six years, compared with the average rate of 60%. Those individual decisions to drop out collectively amount to society-wide stratification. The racial gaps in earning college degrees have hardly budged since 1995.

1

3 Simple as the problem may be to describe, the approach taken by asap is complicated. Rather than target one thing that derails students, the programme tries to tackle many at once. Pupils are given financial help, including money for textbooks and free MetroCards to get around the city. They must meet academic and career advisers several times a month. They are tracked by a data operation that detects pupils in precarious positions before they quit. This worked for Mr Cabrera, who continued to a bachelor’s degree, a few internships and a series of good jobs after that.

4 He is not unusual. Students in the asap programme have a three-year graduation rate of 53%—more than double the 25% rate in the rest of the City University of New York \(cuny\) system and close to triple the national average. In 2015, when external researchers tested these impressive outcomes by randomly assigning students—the gold standard for social science—they found effects of the same magnitude. The greatest gains went to black and Hispanic students, as well as those receiving Pell grants \(most of which go to students with annual family incomes of $20,000 a year or less\). Since then, the programme has grown and community-college systems across the country are trying to replicate it.

5 In New York the average cost of the additional supports amount to $3,500 per student. But such schemes benefit college finances too, by increasing their revenue. Georgia State University’s programme to provide micro-grants, which began in 2012, seemed to boost both graduation rates and university finances.“That’s actually a big driver of this completion movement \[because\] enrolments are not going up,”says Patrick Methvin of the Gates Foundation, which has funded research in the field.“The economics on this are going from nice to necessary.” Though not small, the cost also looks like a pittance compared with many ideas to alleviate intergenerational poverty. A child born poor who gets just a high-school degree has a 50% chance of remaining in poverty as an adult; with a college degree, the chances decline to 17%.

6 More evidence is accumulating to show that the approach works beyond New York. Starting in 2015, three community colleges in Ohio imported the asap model, with some modifications \(such as offering money for petrol rather than for the subway\). A randomisedcontrolled trialby mdrc, a research outfit, found it nearly doubled the chances of completing degrees \(35% compared with 19% in the control group\). Two community colleges in West Virginia are set to try the system next. “We’re quite pleased to see that the model has been attempted in other places, and the numbers tend to look good too,” says Félix Matos Rodríguez, the chancellor of the cuny system.

7 Perhaps the strongest corroboration that the ingredients are indeed right comes from Chicago, where a similar programme has improved the lot of students in the local community-college system. One Million Degrees \(omd\), a project started in 2012, provides tutoring, professional development and cash grants to qualifying students: 80% of them black and Hispanic, 90% qualifying for Pell grants and 60% first-generation students. It is similar to the New York programme because, “if you really ask students what they need and observe what the challenges are”, you arrive in a similar place, says Paige Ponder, the organisation’s ceo. Initial results of a randomised controlled trial conducted by the University ofChicago Poverty Lab of 4,000 applicants found that participants were 35% likelier to persist through the first year of college.Talk to the students in the programme, and you find that no single element boosts their chances of finishing university as much as the whole cocktail.

8 This well-tested, cost-effective scheme has largely escaped national attention. To many, the whole question of equity in American universities can be reduced simply to the racial make-up of the Ivy League institutions. Besides ignoring the incomes of students at those colleges, who tend to be rich whatever their race and colour, this also assigns central importance to the controversial affirmative-action policies of highly selective universities. Although the share of black students attending Harvard is symbolically important, the situation of those happy few is divorced from the continued social immobility among successive cohorts of black students. Endless debate about affirmative action—which could soon wind up before the Supreme Court yet again—is a diversion from a less controversial method that works.

## DAY 84Could the pandemic give America’s labour movement a boost?

### Gig workers are organising, in tech-savvy ways

1 “May day, ho, ho, billionaires have got to go.” Protesters with slogans and placards, security hovering in the back: the gathering outside an Amazon warehouse in Richmond, California, on May 1st had all the trappings of a proper picket line. One thing was different, though—instead of massing together, participants kept a safe distance. The organisers had even chalked “Stand here” on the pavement at intervals of six feet.

2 Like much else, collective action is not the same in a time of covid-19. It is also increasingly widespread. The protest in Richmond, which included demands for higher pay, is part of a wave of petitions, walkouts, no-shows and strikes organised by gig workers, factory employees and fast-food servers across America. Coworker.org, a website that helps workers launch campaigns, has seen their number explode to more than 100 new initiatives a week. Mike Elk of Payday Report, a website, counts 45 coronavirus-related strikes in March and 108 in April. Comparing these data with official statistics is not easy, but the rise in strike action that began in 2018 looks likely to accelerate \(see chart\).

![&#x56FE;&#x7247;](https://uploader.shimo.im/f/0KnCgJIWcJtNDhL9.png!thumbnail?fileGuid=rO0IT6giPfgqZSaA)

3 A pandemic would seem an inopportune moment for a revival in organised labour. Figures due to be released on May 8th, after_The Economist_went to press, were expected to show that America’s unemployment rate exceeded 15% in April, up from 3.5% in February. Many people are grateful simply to have jobs, and do not want to rock the boat. Yet history complicates the picture. Research by Orley Ashenfelter and John Pencavel, labour economists, points to rapid growth in trade-union membership after the Great Depression, when unemployment was about as high as it is today. Other factors, they argue, from “the prevailing attitudes within society” to legislative changes, also help explain the ups and downs of organised labour.

\(为何有双引号——出处or特殊含义？\)

4 Perceptions of unfairness are likely to aid the worker’s cause. The better educated and richer you are, the easier it is to work from home. But many less-skilled workers must venture outdoors, risking their health, even as they realise that the economy would grind to a halt without them.

5 Demands for higher pay or paid sick leave also seem to be carrying weight with better-off workers and consumers. It emerged on May 4th that Tim Bray, a senior engineer at Amazon, had quit “in dismay” over the firings of workers who had organised protests, and called on the firm to expand sick leave and hazard pay. “The warehouse workers are weak and getting weaker,” he wrote in a blog post. “Any plausible solution has to start with increasing their collective strength.”

6 One survey suggests that a majority of Americans’ purchasing decisions will be swayed by how firms treat their workers during the pandemic. Investors may agree: a recent working paper for the National Bureau of Economic Research concludes that companies scoring well on indices of social issues, such as employee welfare and human rights, have fared better on the stockmarket since covid-19 struck.

7 Gig workers had started to organise even before the virus. Having burned through billions of dollars in venture capital, online platforms such as Instacart and Uber are chasing profits. That has often meant less money and tougher conditions for workers, leading them to form such groups as Gig Workers Collective \(gwc\) and Rideshare Drivers United \(rdu\). Activists have developed new forms of collective action, such as turning off their apps at a specified time or refusing to accept gigs, the digital equivalent of a work stoppage.

8 Technology has made organising easier, too. The gwc, explains Vanessa Bain, one of its founders, uses Facebook to get the word out, Telegram for communication and Slack to organise. The rdu’s app, called Solidarity, aims to overcome the difficulties of organising a fragmented workforce, says Ivan Pardo, its developer. It allows activists to schedule calls with disgruntled drivers, organise protests and ask members what their demands should be.

9 The latest wave of collective action will allow workers’ groups to grow and form new connections, predicts Veena Dubal of the University of California’s Hastings College of the Law. The strikes on May Day were the first to be organised jointly by several of them. Yet a revolution in American industrial relations, as happened after the Great Depression, is not quite on the cards. Gig workers are still far from matching the might of big platforms, whose business models often rely on fragmented labour. Thomas Kochan of the mit Sloan School of Management argues that, to increase their leverage, labour groups need to redouble their efforts to make sure they are heard by customers, who can then push firms to change their ways. Protesting outside warehouses, however creatively organised, will probably not do the job. ■

## \# DAY 83How pandemics have inspired art, music and literature

### Certain themes recur over the centuries. The art inspired by covid-19 may be no different

1 WHEN TOURISTS return to Florence, some will wander into its cathedral and be struck by Andrea del Castagno’s“Equestrian Monument of Niccolò da Tolentino”. Painted in 1456, the fresco of the mercenary commander and his horse is an optical illusion. The pair are depicted as a statue and the perspective scheme enables the painting to be viewed from different angles. As they walk on, some of those tourists who admire it may speculate what more the artist might have achieved had not the plague, which returned to Florence in 1457, killed him in his mid-30s.

![&#x56FE;&#x7247;](https://uploader.shimo.im/f/0UfK2fvNffJ7VwgG.png!thumbnail?fileGuid=rO0IT6giPfgqZSaA)

2 Pandemics and culture have gone hand in hand for millennia. The earliest iteration of the disease that did for Andrea del Castagno was the Black Death, which arrived in Europe in 1347. It killed between a third and a half of the population, but it also helped clear a path to the Renaissance by bringing about great changes in the economic and social order. The Black Death did not directly lead to the Renaissance, says John Henderson, the author of a recent book on plagues, “Florence Under Siege”. But it did lead to a greater concentration of wealth among a smaller number of people. “Wages doubled. The rich became even richer,” he says. That, in turn, gave them the means to finance great art.

3 The pandemic may even have left its mark on styles of painting. In the first decade of the 14th century Giotto had produced a cycle of unprecedentedly life-like frescoes in the Arena Chapel in Padua, depicting the expression of human emotions with a realism that became a hallmark of Renaissance art. But, as Leonardo da Vinci wrote, “After \[Giotto\], art fell back.” For a while at least, painters largely abandonedspatial renderingand lively expression for archaic, stylised forms of representation. Professor Henderson suggests the trauma of the plague may have rekindled an enthusiasm for the familiar; just as many under lockdown today have turned to comforting, well-thumbed novels and undemanding old movies.

4 Pandemics shaped creativity in other ways, too. Giovanni Boccaccio’s“The Decameron” \(1353\), in which ten young people swap tales while sheltering from the Black Death, is the best-known example. One of Boccaccio’s stories was borrowed by William Shakespeare for“All’s Well that Ends Well”. They have also inspired operas and works of poetry and prose, including at least one novel in Arabic, Saad Elkhadem’s“The Plague” \(1989\), in which the fear-inducing disease is Gamal Abdel Nasser’s dictatorship.

![&#x56FE;&#x7247;](https://uploader.shimo.im/f/MXh001zBd6qrs1Dw.png!thumbnail?fileGuid=rO0IT6giPfgqZSaA)

5 The virus that ravaged Florence as Boccaccio’s characters spun their yarns returned again and again. The last outbreak in Europe was in 1743 in Messina, the very port through which the disease had entered the continent almost four centuries earlier.Living with the ever-present threat produced genres of pestilential art, often sponsored—lavishly so—by penitential societies or confraternities.The aim was usually to invoke the protection of the Virgin Mary or two saints regarded as particularly effective against disease: Saint Sebastian and Saint Roch.

和这种无处不在的威胁共存中，大量的瘟疫艺术形式被创造出来，这些艺术形式通常是由忏悔性协会或团体慷慨资助的。

6 Meanwhile, doctors and clerics agreed from an early stage on the therapeutic value of music—though they sometimes differed on whether the music that lifted spirits was appropriate for protecting souls. Much devotional music was intended to be sung in the penitential processions that wound their way through the cities of Europe in times of plague.

This has contemporary resonance. In the early stages of lockdown in March, Italians went on their balconies and terraces to sing and play music. In doing so, they were unwittingly imitating their 16th-century predecessors. Concerned that penitential processions encouraged contagion, the Archbishop of Milan, Carlo Borromeo, “encouraged citizens to sing from their doors and windows in order to collectively perform the public rituals while quarantined inside their own homes,” according to Remi Chiu, a musicologist, in “Plague and Music in the Renaissance” \(2017\).

7 Other forms of art have flourished during, or just after, other outbreaks of disease. The first of the three great cholera pandemics of the 19th century, which began in India in 1817, was followed by the first post-apocalyptic novel. Mary Shelley’s “The Last Man” \(1826\) offers an even grimmer vision of humanity’s future than Cormac McCarthy’s “The Road” \(2006\). The Austrian artist Egon Schiele drew his mentor, Gustav Klimt, as he lay dying from the influenza pandemic in 1918 \(known, unfairly, as the “Spanish flu”\). Schiele himself succumbed after finishing the drawing. Virginia Woolf, who suffered heart damage from her encounter with the flu, conferred her resulting debilitation on the title character of her novel, “Mrs Dalloway” \(1925\).

8 Elizabeth Outka, a professor at the University of Richmond in Virginia, argues that traces of the psychological effects of the 1918-20 flu pandemic can also be detected in works of the inter-war period written by other survivors. She sees the shadow of the virus in T.S. Eliot’s “The Waste Land” \(1922\), in which death can seem ever-present:

_Under the brown fog of a winter dawn,_

_A crowd flowed over London Bridge, so many,_

_I had not thought death had undone so many._

9 What do these forms of art, both modern and older, have in common? Several themes recur. One is the notion of a pandemic as a “great leveller”. It is a dubious proposition in the light of current studies showing the poor are hit the worst, but before statistical analysis, it was a common motif in the 15th-century artistic genre of the Dance of Death. It features in Edgar Allan Poe’s cholera-inspired short story, “The Masque of the Red Death” \(1842\), in which a prince and his court shut themselves away to escape an epidemic, but find the lethal disease has slipped in as an uninvited guest at their masked ball. In some of the early commentary around covid-19, the theme crept back in.

10 Another recurring notion is that contagious illnesses bring out the best and worst in humanity. It is among the themes of Italy’s most celebrated 19th-century novel, Alessandro Manzoni’s “The Betrothed” \(1827\). Set during the plague of Milan in 1629-31, the story contrasts the heroic altruism of Fra Cristoforo, a Capuchin friar, with the cowardice and worldliness of another priest, Don Abbondio. Soon after Italy went into lockdown in March, Pope Francis told his priests: “in times of pandemic, you should not be Don Abbondios”. It was an ominous reproof. In the novel, Don Abbondio lives; Fra Cristoforo is infected and dies.

11 That gives an ironic twist to the most prevalent theme of all: the pandemic as punishment. For millennia humans have needed to rationalise catastrophe, and in doing so have turned to the notion of the wrath of God or the Gods. In Homer’s “The Iliad”, Apollo infects the Achaeans for kidnapping the comely daughters of one of his priests and turning them into sex slaves. In the Old Testament, God sends a plague to the Israelites on the puzzling grounds that King David had ordered a census. And in his account of the first great outbreak of plague in Europe, which began in 541, the Byzantine historian Procopius puts it all down to God’s will. But he noted the disease, which went on to halve the population of Europe by around 700, had a knack of letting the worst survive \(possibly a dig at the emperor Justinian, who contracted the disease, but recovered\).

12 Islam took the view that the victims of pandemics were martyrs who thus went straight to heaven. But millions of Christians have died of infectious diseases believing it was their own fault. Countless paintings from the 14th to the 17th centuries show an angry God presiding over indiscriminate annihilation. As Susan Sontag argued in “Illness as Metaphor” \(1978\), victim-blaming has continued in modern times. Cancer was once seen as the result of inhibited emotions. AIDS was stigmatised for years as the presumed penalty for uninhibited ones.

13 So what of covid-19? Some American evangelical preachers are keen to portray it as a hoax rather than a reprisal. But Ralph Drollinger, the leader of the White House bible study group, has ascribed it to God’s disgust with gays, lesbians and environmentalists. By contrast Jane Goodall, a leading environmental campaigner, has argued that “it’s our messing with nature, cutting down forests, bringing people and animals close together, hunting animals and eating them…that’s led to these viruses spreading from animals to people.” Meanwhile, the covid-inspired novels, artwork, and music have yet to materialise. When they do, they will join a long, rich tradition.

## DAY 82When cinemas reopen they will not be the same

### Covid-19’s legacy will be fewer theatres, showing biggerblockbusters

1 The lights are off in many Florida businesses. But after dark, the glow of the OcalaDrive-In’s 90-foot screen can be seen from a quarter of a mile down the highway. With half the parking spaces in its seven-acre plotfenced offto allow for social distancing, the Ocala has room for 240 vehicles—and it is full every night. “We’re the only thing going right now,” says John Watzke, the owner. Families sit out in deckchairs orperchbeneath opentailgatesto see a double-bill of “Trolls World Tour” and “Back to the Future” for $6 per adult \(under-fives and pets go free\). Mr Watzke decided to stay open because of his experience of Hurricane Katrina in 2005, when “anything that brought a few minutes of normal lifestyle to us was appreciated.”

2 For most of America’s nearly 6,000 cinemas, life is far from normal. All but a handful have been shut since March. And although some states have begun to ease the lockdown, it will be months before theatres raise their curtains. A quarter of Americans say they won’t go back to the movies until at least the autumn, so studios are holding their films. No releases are planned for the July 4th weekend, normally acovetedslot. The next big-budgetpremiere, “Tenet”, an actionflickfrom Warner Bros, is tentatively down for July 17th.

3 That may be longer than some cinemas can wait. Already indebted after years of investing in reclining seats and the like, they face four months without revenue, followed byonly a slow return to businessas usual. The world’s largest chain, amc, which has around 1,000 theatres, thebulkof them in America, last month borrowed an emergency $500m, which ought to tide it over until November. But this will bring its total debt to nearly ten timesgross operating profit, according to Moody’s, a rating agency. Restructuring looks likely. Cineworld, the second-largest chain, said in March that it would be at risk of bankruptcy if forced to close for more than three months. The stock prices of both firms have plunged since the start of the year.

### Show-stopper

4 America already has 1,600 fewer cinemas than at the turn of the century. Back then the average American went to the movies five times a year; last year it was three and a half. As more theatres close or cut costs and thevirus lingers, the couch will become more tempting still.

5 So Hollywood studios are exploring alternatives. Although it hit screens on April 10th, amid the pandemic, “Trolls World Tour” has been seen well beyond the Ocala, since Universal Pictures decided to put the animation online on the same day. At $20 for a 48-hour download, it took $95m in America in its first three weeks, the_Wall Street Journal_reported. That is less than the $125m the previous “Trolls” movie made at the box office in the same period. But Universal could keep about 80% of download revenues rather than giving almost half to theatres. The studiohailedthe experiment as a success and said it would do more simultaneous releases in future.

6 Cinema bosses are naturally horrified by this breaking of the 90-day window in which films are normally shown exclusively on the big screen; amc says it will no longer show any Universal films, adding with a suitably theatrical flourish that this is “not some hollow or ill-considered threat”. Cineworld says it too willboycottfilms that break the window. But Universal is not the only studio going online. Warner has arranged a digital-only release for “Scoob!”, which was due in theatres on May 15th. Paramount has sold “The Lovebirds” to Netflix. Even Disney, which does better at the box office than any other studio, has decided to put “Artemis Fowl” on its Disney+ streaming service, skipping the cinema.

7 These decisions were all provoked by the pandemic. But studios were already under pressure to provide content for the streaming services launched by their parent companies.When Netflix is commissioning hits and putting them online immediately,Disney cannotserve upa diet of months-old films. Hence features like its remake of “Robin Hood”, which in the past might have got an outing at the cinema, are going straight to Disney+. This year’s Oscars will admit streaming-only films, in what the Academy insists is a covid-inducedone-off. But last year’s best-picture nominations included two Netflix films—“The Irishman” and “Marriage Story”—that had minimal theatre runs.

8 It isn’t yet time for the credits to roll for the cinema.This year’s biggest titles, from James Bond to Wonder Woman, have been postponed rather than put online. Universal itself has delayed the latest in its “Fast and Furious” series until next April. Given that previous “Furious” films have taken as much as $1.2bn at the worldwide box office, it cannot afford to miss a theatre run.

9 But increasingly, cinematic releases make sense only for the biggest blockbusters. Studios have realised that betting heavily on a few expensive “tentpoles” brings in more money than placing lots of smaller stakes. Blockbusters’ marketing costs are proportionally lower than those of middling movies, andshelling outfor globally famous stars makes it easier to sell a film internationally. With cinema attendance in decline in America, titles must sparkle to be one of the few that people bother going to see. And so ever-greater rewards areaccruingto the biggest hits. Last year the five highest-grossing films took a quarter of the domestic box-office, nearly double the top five’s share in 2000.

10 Critics complain that the emphasis on “event movies” is making studios tediously conservative about what they green-light. All of America’s ten most successful films last year were part of a series, like “Avengers: Endgame”, or remakes, like “The Lion King”. That was the case for only two of the top ten in 2000. And what Hollywood produces, the rest of the world watches: last year’s global top ten was almost identical to America’s. In truth, studios won’t stop making lower-budget features; apart from anything else, they need to try out new actors and new ideas \(it wasn’t always obvious that comic-book adaptations would be money-spinners\). But increasingly, the tiddlers will go straight to streaming.

11 All this is only a continuation of television’s century-longsiphoningof content away from the cinema. Movie theatres were once the home of all types of video. From the 1950s tv nabbed news, cartoons and serials, leaving cinemas with only feature films. Now streaming issucking upmany of those too, so that the theatre is a place to visit just for event movies. Something is being lost: an evening at home with Netflix isn’t quite the same as a night at the Ocala, reflects Mr Watzke. People may enjoy a film just as much on tv. But “if they see it at the drive-in, it’s a memory.” ■

## \# DAY 81The market v the real economy

### Financial markets have got out ofwhackwith the economy. Something has to give

1 Stockmarket historyis packed withdrama: the 1929 crash; Black Monday in 1987, when share prices lost 20% in a day; thedotcom maniain 1999. With suchprecedents, nothing should come as a surprise, but the past eight weeks have been remarkable, nonetheless. Agut-wrenchingsell-off in shares has been followed by adeliriousrallyin America. Between February 19th and March 23rd, the s&p 500 index lost a third of its value. With barely a pause it has since rocketed, recovering more than half its loss. Thecatalystwas news that the Federal Reserve would buy corporate bonds, helping big firms finance their debts. Investors shifted from panic to optimismwithout missing a beat.

2 This rosy view from Wall Street should make you uneasy \(see[article](https://www.economist.com/finance-and-economics/2020/05/07/a-perky-stockmarket-v-a-glum-economy)\). It contrasts with markets elsewhere. Shares in Britain and continental Europe, for example, have recovered moresluggishly. And it is a world away from life on Main Street. Even as the lockdown eases in America, the blow to jobs has beensavage, with unemployment rising from 4% to about 16%, the highest rate since records began in 1948. While big firms’ shares soar and they get help from the Fed, small businesses are struggling to get cash from Uncle Sam.

3 Wounds from the financial crisis of 2007-09 are being reopened. “This is the second time we’ve bailed their asses out,” grumbled Joe Biden, the Democratic presidential candidate, last month. The battle over who pays for the fiscal burdens of the pandemic is just beginning. On the present trajectory, a backlash against big business is likely.

4 Start with events in the markets. Much of the improved mood is because of the Fed, which has acted more dramatically than other central banks, buying up assets on an unimagined scale. It is committed to purchasing even more corporate debt, including high-yield “junk” bonds. The market for new issues of corporate bonds, which froze in February, has reopened in spectacular style. Companies have issued $560bn of bonds in the past six weeks, double the normal level. Even beached cruise-line firms have been able to raise cash, albeit at a high price. A cascade of bankruptcies at big firms has been forestalled. The central bank has, in effect, backstopped the cashflow of America Inc. The stockmarket has taken the hint and climbed.

5 The Fed has little choice—a run on the corporate-bond market would worsen a deep recession. Investors have cheered it on by piling into shares. They have nowhere else good to put their cash. Government-bond yields are barely positive in America. They are negative in Japan and much of Europe. You are guaranteed to lose money by holding them tomaturity, and if inflation rises the losses would be painful. So stocks are appealing. By late March prices had fallen by enough to tempt the braver sort.They steeled themselves with the observation that much of the stockmarket’s value is tied to profits that will be made long after the covid-19 slump has given way to recovery.

6 Tellingly, though, the recent rise in share prices has been uneven. Even before the pandemic the market waslopsided, and it has become more so.Boursesin Britain and continental Europe, chock-full of troubled industries like carmaking, banking and energy, havelaggedbehind, and there are renewedjittersover the single currency \(see[article](https://www.economist.com/europe/2020/05/07/germanys-highest-court-takes-issue-with-the-european-central-bank)\). In America investors have put even more faithin a tiny group of tech darlings—Alphabet, Amazon, Apple, Facebook and Microsoft—which now make up a fifth of the s&p 500 index. There is littleeuphoria, just a despairing reach for the handful of businesses judged to be all-weather survivors.

7 At one level, this makes good sense. Asset managers have to put money to work as best they can. But there is something wrong with how fast stock prices have moved and where they have got back to. American shares are now higher than they were in August. This would seem to imply that commerce and the broader economy can get back to business as usual. There are countless threats to such a prospect, but three stand out.

The first is the risk of an aftershock.It is entirely possible that there will be a second wave of infections.And there are also the consequences of asteep recessiontocontend with—American gdp is expected to drop by about 10% in the second quarter compared with a year earlier. Many individual bosses hope that ruthless cost-cutting can help protect their margins and pay down the debtsaccumulatedthrough thefurlough. Butin aggregatethis corporateausteritywill depress demand. The likely outcome isa 90% economy,running far below normal levels.

8 A second hazard to reckon with is fraud. Extended booms tend to encourage shifty behaviour, and the expansion before the covid crash was the longest on record. Years of cheap money and financial engineering mean that accounting shenanigans may now be laid bare. Already there have been two notable scandals in Asia in recent weeks, at Luckin Coffee, a Chinese Starbucks wannabe, and Hin Leong, a Singaporean energy trader that has been hiding giant losses \(see[article](https://www.economist.com/business/2020/05/07/the-buoyant-oil-traders)\). A big fraud or corporate collapse in America could rock the markets’ confidence, much as the demise of Enronshreddedinvestors’ nerves in 2001 and Lehman Brothers led the stockmarket down in 2008.

9 The most overlooked risk is of a political backlash. The slump will hurt smaller firms and leave the bigger corporate survivors in a stronger position,increasing the concentration of some industries that was already a problem before the pandemic.A crisis demands sacrifice and will leave behind a big bill. The clamour for payback will only grow louder if big business has hogged more than its share of the subsidies on offer. It is easy to imaginewindfall taxeson bailed-out industries, or a sharp reversal of the steady drop in thestatutory federal corporate-tax rate, which fell to 21% in 2017 after President Donald Trump’s tax reforms, from a long-term average of well over 30%. Some Democrats want to limit mergers and stop firms returning cash to their owners.

10 For now, equity investors judge that the Fed has their back. But the mood of the markets can shift suddenly, as an extraordinary couple of months has proved. A one-month bear market scarcely seems enough time to absorb all the possible bad news from the pandemic and the huge uncertainty it has created. This stockmarket drama has a few more acts yet.■

## \# DAY 80Arthur Miller

### **Arthur Miller, playwright, died on February 10th, aged 89**

1 FOR most of his life, Arthur Miller was a carpenter. At 14, with the money made from deliveringbagelson his bike round Harlem, he bought enough wood to build a back porch on the family house. In his old age, living on 360 acres in Connecticut, he made tables, chairs, a bed, a cabinet. To make extra-sure the angles were right, he once consulted a mathematician.

2 He loved making plays—which he did better than any other American of the 20th century, with the possible exception only of Tennessee Williams—for much the same reason.They gave him “an architectural pleasure”. He tried novels occasionally and wrote, in “Timebends” in 1987, a chaotic autobiography. But he revelled in the structure of the drama. He thought of Ibsen and Sophocles, his early influences, as master-carpenters, and of his own best plays as careful constructions of “hard actions, facts, the geometry of relationships”. It was no accident that his male characters were often skilful with their hands, even if they were good atlittle else.

3 Yet Mr Miller's plays were not conceived as simple artefacts. He meant them to move minds. If they could not do so, there was no point in writing them. His intention was to show the audience, in ordinary characters they might see every day, truths about themselves that they half-knew but would not acknowledge. Realising they were not alone in whatever they foolishly feared or unwisely hoped for, they might find the courage to change.

4 In “Death of a Salesman” \(1949\), the play that brought him global fame, he displayed in Willy Loman the futility of a salesman's life, the fragility of his dreams, his longing to leave a lasting mark on the world—and also, though Willy could not see it, the persistent strength of his family's love for him. In “A View from the Bridge” \(1955\) heanatomised, in Eddie Carbone, the unacknowledged terrors ofincestuouspassion. In several plays, the last written only a year before his death, he tried to unravel his own relationship with Marilyn Monroe, his wife for almost five years. She remained surrounded, however, by “a darkness that perplexed me”.

5 He also plunged into the past in order to illuminate the present. His account of the 17th-century Salem witch trials in “The Crucible” \(1953\) gave him the metaphor he needed to describe McCarthyism, a plague that touched him directly when he was called before the House UnAmerican Activities Committee in 1956 for attending meetings of communist writers. \(He refused to name names, was held in contempt of Congress, fined, and had his passport withdrawn.\) His play “Broken Glass” \(1994\),ostensiblyabout the 1930s, was intended as a commentary on public indifference to the Yugoslav wars of the 1990s. His audiences did not always notice these parallels, but they were always meant to.

**Fixing on a star**

6 Throughout his work, his message was consistent. Actions had consequences, and the individual was responsible not only for his own acts, but for what he knew others were doing. In “All My Sons” \(1947\), his clearest statement of this philosophy, a father had secured the future of his family by shipping defective aircraft parts that had caused pilots to die; eventually, his own son reported him. There were moments, Mr Miller wrote, “when an individual conscience was all that could keep a world from falling.”

7 On the other hand, his characters were seldom that strong. Outside forces—destiny, law, political authority, sudden catastrophe—often overwhelmed them. As a child during the Depression, he had seen his father's coat-making business destroyed and his mother, whom he remembered in fox-fur and diamonds, reduced toeking outshovelfulsof coal. His father and his colleagues, he noticed, never blamed anyone but themselves for what had happened. Mr Miller, alreadyimbued withhis lifelong socialism, tried to persuade hisshellshockedfather to blame the capitalist system too, and accept thatprofit was wrong.His father, naturally, could not begin to understand him.

8 His career was not alladulation. He had a drypatchin the 1960s, when he felt he did not speak with the accent of the time, and by the 1980s the all-powerful New York critics \(whom he loathed\) seemed to be tired of him. Constantly, critics objected to his blatant stage moralising: “like neon signs”, one wrote, “in a diner window.”

9 Mr Miller wasunapologetic. He had a purpose, he confessed, even beyond teaching. Though he seemed to be didactic, he was in fact asking questions: “How can we be useful?” “Why do we live?” He was, he once admitted, “in love with wonder...the wonder of how things and people got to be what they are.”The aim of each of his plays was to discover which commitment or challenge his main character would accept, and which he would walk away from: “that moment when out of a sky full of stars he fixes on one star.”

10 He remembered his own such moment, when he decided to be a writer. It came when, reading Dostoevsky's “The Brothers Karamazov” as a teenager, he discovered that among the most breathtaking passages were accumulations of hard, simple fact: “the kind of bark on the moonlit trees, the way a window ishinged”. As well as the playwright, it was the carpenter speaking.

## DAY 79The government ponders bailing out universities

### Before the crisis, the government was keen to shrink the university sector. Covid-19 makes it likelier that that will actually happen

1 A quick flick through a student brochure is all it takes to see why universities are so concerned by the pandemic, and the collapse in international travel it haswrought. A British undergraduate studyingclassicsat Oxford, as theprime ministerdid, pays £9,250 \($11,500\) a year for tuition. A Chinese undergraduate on the same course pays £27,285, almost three times as much. Altogether, foreign students last year provided at least a fifth of the income of 48 higher-education institutions, ranging from theLondon School of Economicsto the University of Sunderland. That is why, as a vice-chancellor puts it, “everyone is nervous as hell.”

2 International students are not all that Britain’s vice-chancellors have to worry about these days. Anybusinessthat brings together crowds of people faces trouble. Universities are likely to have to move either some or all of their teaching online. That may mean fewer domestic students, depending on whether the urge to dodge terrible lectures onZoomis greater than the desire to avoid a terrible labour market. Even before the crisis, some universities were looking shaky. Large deficits were common among smaller, less prestigious institutions. And the debt taken on by some of the country’s grandest universities now looks more concerning.

Universities uk, a lobby group, has opened the bidding for government help, petitioning for a £2bn bailout. The decision about whether to provide the cash, and if so how to distribute it, will shape higher education for years to come.

3 Before the crisis, ministers had big ambitions. In his budget on March 11th, Rishi Sunak, the chancellor, promised almost to double research and development spending to £22bn by 2024-25. But the ambition to invest in excellent research coexists with a belief in Downing Street that the sector has grown too big. Dominic Cummings, the prime minister’s chief adviser, has previously questioned the value of “third rate he \[higher-education\] institutions”. Alison Wolf, another adviser who is the country’s most influential thinker on tertiary education, has called the expansion of universities “a bad bargain for the taxpayer and for the student”.

4 Michelle Donelan, the universities minister, has announced that she will tackle the problem of “low-quality” university courses. The government has its sights on universities producingthe fifth of graduates, asidentified by the Institute for Fiscal Studies \(ifs\), a think-tank, who would have been financiallybetter offhad they not attended university. The earnings of those who left university a decade ago suggest that’s true, on average, of female graduates of Bolton University and uc Falmouth \(now Falmouth University\), and of male graduates of 39 universities, including Goldsmiths and Manchester Met.

5 Ministers are not rushing topony upthe cash that Universities uk wants. For the moment, the Office for Students, the higher-education regulator, has demanded a pause in all changes to existing offers until May 4th to prevent afree-for-allin which universitiespoacheach others’ students. Though the eventual impact may be big, higher education is at less immediate risk than other sectors seeking bail-outs, for most universities are relativelyinsulatedat least until the start of the new academic year. The government will wait for the impact on student behaviour to become clearer, allowing it to decide whether tocough up, and if so what it wants in return.

6 Previous Conservative universities ministers have emphasised that they are not afraid to let universities go bust. The Treasury is said to be inclined not to offer universities a bail-out, allowing them to get access to standard business support and intervening onlyon a case-by-case basis.The expectation is that, if the government removes restrictions on recruitment on May 4th, higher-ranking universities will suck up students from lower-ranked peers to make up for the fall in those arriving from abroad.Many of the resulting strugglers would be universities producing graduates who earn less than they would have had they not gone to university.Treasury officials would not be sad to see those shrink or disappear altogether.

7 Yet there are problems with such an approach. Jack Britton of the ifs notes that graduate-earnings data looks at those who left universities in the late 2000s. The post-pandemic labour market may require different skills to the one which preceded it. And letting universities in poorer parts of the country go bust would be difficult to square with Boris Johnson’s desire to “level up” struggling areas. “The preponderance of institutions \[which might need saving\] that are in the north and Midlands is quite embarrassing,” notes a vice-chancellor.

8 Universities uk’s bail-out bid carefully balances universities’ competing interests. It asks for a doubling of the main source of research funding, which would mainly benefit high-ranked ones, helping to make up for the expected shortage of foreign students. In return, these institutions would agree to restrictions on recruitment, so that they do notsuck upstudents from lower-ranked ones. It would also include a “transformation fund”, which could be used by the government to help universities merge with other universities or even further-education colleges, thus helping it to rebalance resources from universities to vocational education. In March the government said it would lay out its plans for further education later this year.

9 Universities hope the bail-out plan would allow them to get through the next few years, before a demographic boom in the number of 18-year-olds comes to their rescue. But recruitment restrictions would mean the government was, in effect, banning students from attending the best institution that would have them, and thus preventing top-rated universitiesfrom taking up the slack in the system.And the bailout would give higher education some protection against the government’s desire for radical reform.

10 On April 29th Gavin Williamson, the education secretary, told mps that his priorities were protecting research, students and the role universities have in local economies—which sounds like a reference to the need to look after poorer places. Those aims will have to be squared with the Treasury’s pressing need to save money and the government’s ambition to squeeze waste out of the sector. It sounds like universities with poor graduate prospects in richer parts of the country should be worried.■
