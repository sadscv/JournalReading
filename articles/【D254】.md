# D254 “Homeland Elegies” dwells on the question of belonging
1 AYAD AKHTAR is best-known for his fearless theatre plays about Muslims, America and finance, the first of which, “Disgraced”, won a Pulitzer prize. “Homeland Elegies”, his new novel, affirms his talent for storytelling and **dazzling** prose. This tale composed of many tales also delivers a **blistering** critique of America’s trajectory over the past 20 years.

2 Recently named president of PEN America, a literary and human-rights organisation, Mr Akhtar has written **prolifically** on American society. His first novel, “American **Dervish**”, was about Muslim life in the Midwest; this one follows his parents’ generation of Pakistani immigrants and their struggle to assimilate, a struggle that divides a father and his American-born son. Partly autobiographical, it is **at once** funny and furious, despairing and indignant.

3 The narrator, a prizewinning playwright like the author, kicks off his excoriating portrait of a dysfunctional country with a hilarious **set piece** on his father’s **infatuation** with Donald Trump. It is the 1990s and Sikander, a **renowned cardiologist**, is sent to treat the reality-TV star for a heart problem, and becomes his greatest fan. Yet as the book unfolds, America proves to be as gripped by “irrational **paranoia**” as Pakistan. Along the way the narrative takes dozens of **detours**: it is an **enfilade** of stories, succeeding one another like the rooms at the Palace of Versailles.

4 Personal and family episodes mix with **riffs** on economics and history, from Indian Partition to antitrust law and Islamic beliefs. Riaz, a hedge-fund manager, makes the narrator rich; a pro-Taliban “uncle” is killed by the CIA. Anti-Muslim prejudice bubbles up. When the narrator tries to donate blood on 9/11, a white American screams: “Nobody wants your fucking Arab blood.”

5 Again and again Mr Akhtar returns to the question of belonging, in both senses. Whose America is this really? Attacks on corporate power and Reaganomics **round out** his jeremiad from the left. But even readers whose politics differ will be **enthralled**. The registers somehow fit together, as Scheherazade meets Cassandra in a chain of stories and dreams. He has hit on an ingenious form for the snapshot age of Instagram, as he updates an enduring American drama: from rags to riches—and back again.
