# DAY 31 The joy of absence
> 公司如何对抗出勤主义魔咒？

1 RONALD REAGAN famously **quipped** that “it’s true hard work never killed anybody, but I figure, why take the chance?” Beyond a certain level, extra effort seems to be **self-defeating**. Studies suggest that, after around 50 hours a week, employee productivity declines sharply.

> 罗纳德·里根 (RONALD REAGAN) 有句很有名的玩笑话：“的确，努力工作从未致死，但我认为，为什么要冒此风险呢？”额外工作超出一定量似乎会适得其反。诸多研究表明，每周工作时间超过约 50 小时，员工的工作效率就会急剧下降。

2 But that doesn’t stop some managers from demanding that workers stay chained to their desk for long periods. At the blood-testing firm Theranos, Sunny Balwani, boyfriend of the founder, Elizabeth Holmes, had an obsession with employee hours, and would tour the engineering department at 7.30pm to check people were at their desks. All those hours were wasted when the company eventually collapsed (prosecutors have charged Ms Holmes with fraud).

> 但即便如此，一些经理还是要求员工长时间待在工位上。在血液检测公司泰拉诺斯 (Theranos)，创始人伊丽莎白·霍尔莫斯 (Elizabeth Holmes) 的男朋友萨尼·鲍尔瓦尼 (Sunny Balwani) 是工时控，下午 7:30 便到工程部查岗，确保员工都在工位上。公司最后倒闭了（检察官控告霍尔莫斯欺诈），这些加班时间也就都浪费了。

3 Jack Ma, the founder of Alibaba, the Chinese e-commerce group, recently praised the 996 model, where employees work from 9am to 9pm, six days a week, as a “great opportunity”. To be fair, Mr Ma said employers should not **mandate** such hours. Still presenteeism is the curse of the modern office worker.

> 中国电商集团阿里巴巴的创始人马云最近力挺 996 工作模式，称之为员工的“绝佳机会”，在 996 工作模式下，员工工作时间为早上 9 点到晚上 9 点，一周六天。马云也表示，为了公平起见，雇主不应强制要求 996。但可见出勤主义依旧是现代办公室白领的魔咒。

4 There will be days when you do not have much to do; perhaps because you are waiting for someone else in a different department, or a different company, to respond to a request. As the clock ticks past 5pm, there may be no purpose in staying at your desk. But you can see your boss hard at work and, more important, they can see you. So you make an effort to look busy.

> 工作中肯定会有比较清闲的时候；或许就是在别的部门或公司等人给回信。下午 5 点之后，再呆在工位上也许毫无必要。但你看到老板还在努力工作，更重要的是，老板可以看见你，于是自己也努力看起来忙一点。
>

5 Some of this may be a self-perpetuating cycle. If bosses do not like to go home before their underlings, and underlings fear leaving before their bosses, everyone is trapped. Staff may feel that they will not get a pay rise, or a promotion, if they are not seen to be putting in maximum effort. This is easily confused with long hours. Managers, who are often no good at judging employees’ performance, use time in the office as a **proxy**.

> 有时候会陷入无限循环。如果老板不想比下属提前回家，下属也不敢比老板提前下班，所有人都被束缚。员工或许觉得，如果自己看起来没有付出全力，就不会升职加薪。付出全力很容易与长时间工作相混淆。经理们往往不善于判断员工的业绩表现，就拿在办公室待的时间长短作为衡量标准。

6 The consequence is often wasted effort. To adjust the old joke about the Soviet Union: “We pretend to work and managers pretend to believe us.” Rather than work hard, you toil to make bosses think that you are. Leaving a jacket on your office chair, walking around purposefully with a clipboard, and sending out emails at odd hours are three of the best known tricks. After a while this can result in collective self-delusion that it is actual work.

> 结果就是往往努力都会白费。之前有句形容苏联的玩笑话：“我们假装工作，经理也假装相信。”现在这句话可以改为：你并没有努力工作，而是费尽心思让老板觉得如此。最常见的伎俩有以下三个：在办公椅上留件外套，拿着写字板一本正经地闲逛，在加班时间发邮件。过段时间，这就造成大家都自欺欺人，认为这就是在真正工作。

7 But presenteeism has more serious consequences. It is perhaps most prevalent in Japan, where people attend the office even when they are in discomfort. In doing so, they are neither doing themselves, or their employers, any favours.

> 但是出勤主义还会带来更严重的后果。或许在日本最为普遍，日本员工即便抱恙也要上班。这样做对自己对雇主都无益。

8 As well as reduced productivity, this can mean greater medical expenses for the employer. According to a study in the Journal of Occupation and Environmental Medicine, these costs can be six times higher for employers than the costs of absenteeism among workers. To take one example, research published in the British Medical Journal found that Japanese employees with lower back pain were three times more likely to turn up for work than in Britain. As a result, those workers were more likely to experience greater pain and to suffer from depression. What could be more depressing than being in pain, and feeling trapped at work?

> （出勤主义）不仅意味着工作效率降低，也可能给雇主带来更大的医疗费用开支。职业及环境医学期刊 (Journal of Occupation and Environmental Medicine) 的一项研究表明，这部分成本是员工旷工成本的七倍。再比如，英国医疗期刊 (British Medical Journal) 发表的一项研究表明，在日本，患腰痛员工的出勤率比英国高三倍。最后这些员工更容易疼痛加重，心情抑郁。还有什么比身染痛疾还要工作更让人郁闷呢？

9 None of this is to say that employers are not entitled to expect workers to be in the office for a decent proportion of time. Inevitably there will be a need for some (preferably short) meetings. Dealing with colleagues face-to-face creates a feeling of camaraderie, allows for a useful exchange of ideas and enables workers to have a better sense of their mutual needs.

> 这并不是说雇主无权期望员工适当加班。毋庸置疑，有些会议需要加班（但会议最好简短），同事之间面对面工作会催生“革命友谊”，在这种氛围下，员工可以高效交流想法，也会更好地理解彼此的需求。

10 In the grand sweep of humanity, presenteeism is a recent phenomenon. Before the industrial era, most people worked in their own farm or workshop and were paid for the amount they produced. Factories emerged because new machines were much more efficient than cottage-industry methods, and only a large employer with capital could afford them. Suddenly, workers were paid not for their output but for their time, and were required to clock in and out. But modern machinery like smartphones and laptops is portable. It can be used as easily at home as in the office.

> 在人类发展历史长河中，出勤主义始于当代。在工业时代之前，大多数人在自己的农场、作坊或工作室工作，按生产量获取报酬。新型机器比家庭作坊的生产方式高效地多，工厂便应运而生，而只有掌握资本的大雇主才开得起工厂。一下子，员工不再以生产量获取报酬，而是以工时为标准，并强制打卡上下班。但是像智能手机和笔记本电脑等现代设备方便携带，在家和办公室都一样可以方便办公（就没有必要强制打卡）。

11 Turning an office into a prison, with inmates allowed home for the evenings, does nothing for creativity that is increasingly demanded of office workers as routine tasks are automated. To be productive you need presence of mind, not being present in the flesh.

> 日常工作日益自动化，对办公室白领的创造力要求也与日俱增。而把办公室打造成监狱，晚上才放“犯人”回家，这对创造力毫无帮助。高效工作需要心神俱在，而非无所事事地加班。
