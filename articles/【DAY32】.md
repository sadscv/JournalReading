1 THE internet has transformed the way people work and communicate. It has **upended** industries, from entertainment to retailing. But its most profound effect may well be on the biggest decision that most people make—choosing a mate.

2 In the early 1990s the notion of meeting a partner online seemed **freakish**, and not a little **pathetic**. Today, in many places, it is normal. Smartphones have put virtual bars in people’s pockets, where **singletons** can mingle free from the constraints of social or physical geography. Globally, at least 200m people use digital dating services every month. In America more than a third of marriages now start with an online match-up. The internet is the second-most-popular way for Americans to meet people of the opposite sex, and is fast catching up with real-world “friend of a friend” introductions.

> 20世纪90年代早期，网友约会近乎荒唐，极度离谱，如今在许多地方已是数见不鲜。智能手机提供触手可及的虚拟社交平台，单身人士得以跳脱社交圈，跨越地域空间，进行网络社交。全球范围内，婚恋网络平台月活用户人数逾2亿。在美国，感情始于婚恋网络平台而终成眷属的情侣逾三分之一。网络约会风靡美国，正迎头赶上最受欢迎的传统相亲方式——熟人介绍。

3 Digital dating is a massive social experiment, conducted on one of humanity’s most intimate and vital processes. Its effects are only just starting to become visible .

4 Meeting a mate over the internet is fundamentally different from meeting one offline. In the physical world, partners are found in family networks or among circles of friends and colleagues. Meeting a friend of a friend is the norm. People who meet online are overwhelmingly likely to be strangers. As a result, dating digitally offers much greater choice. A bar, choir or office might have a few tens of potential partners for any one person. Online there are tens of thousands.

> 网络约会与线下约会大相径庭。在现实生活中，相亲对象无非是家族宗亲，好友同事。在线下，交友对象总是沾亲带故。在线上，几乎彼此素昧平生。网络约会上可供选择的伴侣更多更广。在酒吧，唱诗班或办公室中，潜在交往对象区区几十；而网上潜在伴侣却数以万计。

5 This greater choice—plus the fact that digital connections are made only with mutual consent—makes the digital dating market far more efficient than the offline kind. For some, that is bad news. Because of the **gulf** in pickiness between the sexes, a few straight men are doomed never to get any matches at all. On Tantan, a Chinese app, men express interest in 60% of women they see, but women are interested in just 6% of men; this dynamic means that 5% of men never receive a match. In offline dating, with a much smaller pool of men to fish from, straight women are more likely to couple up with men who would not get a look-in online.

> 婚恋网络平台上，除可供选择对象众多之外，平台牵线搭桥以双方两厢情愿为前提。毋庸置疑，比起线下约会，网络约会效率更高。但这对一些人不利。在网络约会平台上，男女择偶标准差异巨大，少数异性恋男士注定找不到对象。一款名为探探的中国APP上，男性一见倾心比例高达60%，而女性的仅为6%；这种互动方式意味着5%的男性找不到女朋友。在线下约会中，可选之人寥寥无几，异性恋女士更愿牵手没有线上交友机会的男士。

6 For most people, however, digital dating offers better outcomes. Research has found that marriages in America between people who meet online are likely to last longer; such couples profess to be happier than those who met offline. The **whiff** of moral panic surrounding dating apps is vastly overblown. Precious little evidence exists to show that opportunities online are encouraging **infidelity**. In America, divorce rates climbed until just before the advent of the internet, and have fallen since.

> 即便如此，对于绝大多数人，网络约会裨益颇多。有研究显示，在美国，缘起于互联网的婚姻似乎维持得更长久。相比线下相亲成功的人士，网恋人士表示婚姻幸福感更强。约会软件引发道德问题的言论夸大其词，弄得人心惶惶。鲜有证据表明，网络约会引诱人们背叛婚姻（出轨）。在美国，互联网问世之前，离婚率早已节节攀升，进入互联网时代，离婚率反倒有所下降。

7 Online dating is a particular boon for those with very particular requirements. Jdate allows daters to filter out matches who would not consider converting to Judaism, for instance. A vastly bigger market has had dramatic results for same-sex daters in particular. In America, 70% of gay people meet their partners online. This searchable spectrum of sexual diversity is a boon: more people can find the intimacy they seek.

> 对于苛刻的单身人士而言，互联网约会不啻为一大福音。比如，Jdate约会平台可以筛除犹太教的怀疑论者。网络婚恋市场日益广阔，对同性恋群体影响尤为巨大。在美国，在网上牵手成功的同性恋占比高达70%。根据性取向进行检索有利于更多的人找到如意伴侣。

8 There are problems with the modern way of love, however. Many users complain of stress when confronted with the brutal realities of the digital meat market, and their place within it. Negative emotions about body image existed before the internet, but they are amplified when strangers can issue snap judgments on attractiveness. Digital dating has been linked to depression. The same problems that afflict other digital platforms recur in this realm, from **scams** to fake accounts: 10% of all newly created dating profiles do not belong to real people.

> 然而，网络婚恋同样弊端丛生。不少用户怨声载道，网络相亲地变为猎奇场，身在其中的境遇窘迫不堪，种种残酷的现实令人压力山大。互联网问世之前，自我形象产生的负面情绪早已有之，如今互联网时代，陌生人可以轻率地对他人魅力评头论足，由此负面情绪加剧。网络约会与抑郁症有着千丝万缕联系。困扰其他网络平台的问题也蔓延至网络婚恋领域，从诈骗到虚假注册信息，不胜枚举：虚假用户信息占比竟达10%。

9 This new world of romance may also have unintended consequences for society. The fact that online daters have so much more choice can break down barriers: evidence suggests that the internet is boosting interracial marriages by bypassing homogenous social groups. But daters are also more able to choose partners like themselves. Assortative mating, the process whereby people with similar education levels and incomes pair up, already shoulders some of the blame for income inequality. Online dating may make the effect more pronounced: education levels are displayed prominently on dating profiles in a way they would never be offline. It is not hard to imagine dating services of the future matching people by preferred traits, as determined by uploaded . Dating firms also suffer from an inherent conflict of interest. Perfect matching would leave them bereft of paying customers.

> 婚恋网站也可能给社会带来意外之喜。线上用户选择更广，如此，各种障碍消弭于无形——有证据表明，网络婚恋能跨越不同社交圈，促进跨种族婚姻。但同时人们也容易寻觅到门当户对的伴侣。择偶注重出身门第早已饱受诟病——教育程度相近，个人收入相当的人缔结连理，在一定程度上造成收入不均的格局。如此不公现象可能因婚恋网站愈演愈烈。线上约会，个人信息中教育背景至关重要，但在线下相亲中，人们从不看重这一点。不难想象在未来，用户上传的个人信息主导算法匹配——婚恋网络平台根据用户个人喜好推荐伴侣。在线婚恋公司业务也存在利益冲突，帮助单身人士找到灵魂伴侣，反而导致公司流失大量付费用户。
>

10 The domination of online dating by a handful of firms and their algorithms is another source of worry. Dating apps do not benefit from exactly the same sort of network effects as other tech platforms: a person’s friends do not need to be on a specific dating site, for example. But the feedback loop between large pools of data, generated by ever-growing numbers of users attracted to an ever-improving product, still exists. The entry into the market of Facebook, armed with data from its 2.2bn users, will provide clues as to whether online dating will inexorably consolidate into fewer, larger platforms.

> 在线婚恋产业由屈指可数的几家公司主导，这些公司的算法同样令人担忧。不同于其他科技网络公司，社交约会软件难从网络效应中获益：比如，朋友们彼此没必要用同一个婚恋平台。但是，产品服务不断升级，吸引的用户数量激增，海量数据库之间的反馈回路依然发挥作用。坐拥22亿用户数据的商业巨擘脸书收购网络婚恋软件平台，这可能预示在线婚恋产业将不可避免为寥寥几家巨头企业把控。

11But even if the market does not become ever more concentrated, the process of coupling (or not) has unquestionably become more centralised. Romance used to be a distributed activity which took place in a **profusion** of bars, clubs, churches and offices; now enormous numbers of people rely on a few companies to meet their mate. That hands a small number of coders, tweaking the algorithms that determine who sees whom across the virtual bar, tremendous power to engineer mating outcomes. In authoritarian societies especially, the prospect of algorithmically arranged marriages ought to cause some disquiet. Competition offers some protection against such a possibility; so too might greater transparency over the principles used by dating apps to match people up.Yet such concerns should not obscure the good that comes from the modern way of romance. The right partners can elevate and nourish each other. The wrong ones can ruin both their lives. Digital dating offers millions of people a more efficient way to find a good mate. That is something to love.

> 即使网络婚恋市场不会为巨头控制，寻找伴侣的方式也已走向集中（不管结果成功与否），这毋庸置疑。以往，在各种各样酒吧，俱乐部，教堂乃至办公室，人们可能邂逅爱情；如今，千千万万人仅仅依靠几家公司寻找伴侣。这就赋予少数程序员巨大影响力：一手“导演”这场线上相亲大戏，稍稍修改算法就能决定谁与谁跨越无形障碍相见。尤其在专制集权的社会，要是按照算法安排相亲，势必会引起不少焦虑。市场竞争在一定程度上避免了这种可能性，也能令婚恋平台配对机制更加透明。总体而言，线上约会这种现代化相亲方式瑕不掩瑜。遇到对的人，双方相濡以沫，升华彼此；遇到错的人无异于走向毁灭。得益于线婚恋平台，数以百万计单身人士能更加高效地寻觅伴侣。这种觅得真爱的方式令人啧啧称赞。

> 直译为“滑人”，意味着网络相亲过于草率，看脸看钱看地位看文凭就是不看人品，却不知伴侣的优良品性才是刚需。例如，探探这样的约会平台，根据注册用个人基本信息，兴趣爱好，地理位置等，自动匹配合适人选，用户只需在手机上轻轻一滑，选择发展的对象。如果感兴趣，往右滑，无感，则往左滑，方式简单粗暴。基于大数据算法的网络约会平台，用户所做的选择太草率，太感性，太任性。毕竟，要找的是永恒真爱，而非一段浪漫露水情，单凭上传的个人信息，照片，瞬间决定是否列入备选之列实在太不明智。
