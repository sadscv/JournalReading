1 IF BANYAN HAD to choose one country in which to ride out a pandemic, it would surely be Japan. Early 19th-century woodblock prints of bathing testify to Japan’s old and admirable cult of cleanliness. Modern Japanese have for years been quick to don a face mask at the first sniffle, out of consideration for others. And the population responds swiftly to public messaging.

> 如果菩提亚洲专栏（banyan）必须选出一个国家安然度过流行病的侵扰，那个国家一定是日本。19世纪初的沐浴版画证实着日本人自古以来那令人钦佩的崇尚清洁的程度。现代日本人出于为他人考虑，从来只要一打喷嚏都会马上蒙住脸。并且日本民众也对政府通知响应迅速。

2 Hygiene measures advocated against covid-19 since mid-January emphasise frequent washing of hands. This has surely helped slow the spread of the coronavirus, especially given that of Japan’s 1,035 covid-19 cases and 12 deaths, most are associated with a cruise ship held for weeks off Yokohoma. One striking and positive side-effect is already apparent: unlike in Europe or America, doctors report sharp falls in cases of ordinary flu, not only compared with previous years but also with the first part of the winter. Given that 3,300 deaths were attributed to flu in Japan in 2018, the good hygiene **inculcated** in recent months may well have saved far more lives than covid-19 has claimed.

> 一月中旬以来，为抗击新冠肺炎施行的卫生措施着重强调要勤洗手。日本1035例现存新冠病例及12例死亡病例中，多数病例都与停靠在横滨港外的游轮有关，这说明卫生措施无疑有效减缓了新型冠状肺炎的传播。这也带来了一个显著的积极影响：与欧洲和美国不同，日本医生报告称，普通流感病例与往年及与初冬时相比都大幅下降。2018年日本因流感死亡的人数达3300人，这几个月养成的良好卫生习惯可能已经拯救了比新冠病例还多得多的生命。

3 For all that, social strains have shown in recent days. In Tokyo scuffles have broken out in queues for facemasks outside pharmacies. Panic-buying of toilet paper has left shelves bare. A photograph of toilet rolls in a public lavatory chained to their dispenser with a bicycle lock has done the rounds. While hardly “Lord of the Flies”, it is all highly unusual in such a well-behaved country.

> 尽管如此，社会紧张度近来日益上升。东京药店外排队购买口罩的人们起了冲突。人们由于恐慌将厕纸抢购一空。一张公厕卷纸被用自行车锁封在抽纸盒子里的照片迅速传开。虽然没像《蝇王》中那样，但一个如此有教养的国家里出现这样的事依然极不寻常。

4 Blame a squall of doubt over the government of the usually assertive prime minister, Abe Shinzo. His problems seem, precisely, to have begun with the cruise ship, the Diamond Princess. When cases of covid-19, contracted overseas, became clear among the 3,700 people aboard, measures to isolate them failed badly. The vessel was, as one passenger put it, a floating petri dish, as the number of infected soared to over 700, with seven deaths. Extraordinarily, crew were eventually let ashore from the infected vessel, and Japanese passengers allowed to return home on public transport, with no further quarantine measures.

> 公众对政府的质疑席卷而来，这要怪平素独断的首相安倍晋三。安倍的问题看似正是因 “钻石公主号”游轮而起。当游轮上的3700人中有确诊在海外感染新冠肺炎的病例时，隔离这些人的措施极为失败。如一名乘客所说，当感染人数激增超过700，死亡人数达到7人，游轮就是一个漂浮的病毒培养皿。最意想不到的是，最终感染游轮上的全体船员都被允许上岸，且日籍乘客可以乘坐公共交通回家，并没有进一步的隔离措施。

5 When it comes to bumbling crisis management, Japan has form. After the Kobe earthquake in 1995, yakuza (gangsters) set up soup kitchens, so slow was government help to arrive. Bureaucratic disarray ruled in the Diamond Princess’s handling, too. European ambassadors with nationals aboard complained they did not know who in the government to call. Fans wondered whether Mr Abe, invisible during the crisis, had lost his touch. His hitherto unassailable poll ratings fell sharply.

> 谈到危机公关，日本表现得可谓错误百出。1995年神户地震后，政府援助迟迟不到，日本八九三黑帮（土匪）搭起了流动厨房施舍食物。混乱的官僚体制也主宰了“钻石公主号”事件的处理方式。欧洲国家的大使抱怨说，本国公民正在游轮上，他们却不知道要找哪个日本政府官员求助。在危机中没起到什么作用的安倍让其拥护者怀疑他是否已开始走下坡路。他迄今为止难以撼动的支持率大幅下降。

6 To contain the damage to his reputation as well as the coronavirus, on February 27th Mr Abe took the initiative, telling all schools to close until April. Preparing for the worst, he rushed through legislation this week allowing a state of emergency to be declared. And he unveiled an emergency spending package.

> 为了防止自身名誉继续受损、控制疫情发展，安倍于2月27日主张让所有学校停课至四月份。他为最坏的情况作打算，本周匆忙通过法令宣布进入紧急状态，并出台了一份应急支出方案。
>

7 The assertive Abe, then, is back. So much so that questions are growing about what expert advice, if any, he drew on for his schools decision. New social stresses will surely emerge, not least for working mothers (it never seems to be fathers) who must now drum up weeks of day-time childcare. “The government does not grasp what it’s like to raise children,” one mother complains.

> 果决的安倍便终究归来了。果决得以至于人们质疑他利用了什么专家建议（如果他用了的话）做出关闭学校的决策。毋庸置疑，新的社会压力将会继续出现，尤其是职场妈妈们（爸爸们看似从来不必如此）现在必须费力找到好几周的日间儿童托管。一位妈妈抱怨说，“政府并不能体会养育孩子是什么样的”。

8 The government claims that Japan will return to normal in April. That seems implausible. A state visit by the president, which was supposed to put the two countries’ listing relationship on an even keel, has already been postponed. There is little political cost to Mr Abe—after all, nationalists who backed his rise to power had been grumbling about his hosting the leader.

> 政府宣称日本将会在四月份恢复正常。但那看似不太可行。中国为两国和平建交到访日本的行程已经推迟。但这对安倍没什么政治上的后果——毕竟支持他上任的民族主义者们本来就对他要接待这位领导的做法有所怨言。

9 Much more rides on the Olympic Games in Tokyo this summer. Mr Abe intends them to foster the patriotism whose absence among ordinary Japanese he laments. He wants the games to make Japan seem open, global and even multicultural. And, though vastly over budget, they are to crown the prime minister’s seven-year rule.

> 依靠今夏东京奥运会来达成的事还有更多。安倍对日本民众缺失爱国情怀很是失望，想要借奥运会让人们更加爱国。他还想通过奥运会来使日本变得更开放、更国际化以及文化多元化。此外，虽然奥运会支出远远超出政府预算，但首相安倍希望能借此圆满实现七年连任。
>

10 To cancel the games would generate not only disappointment among ordinary Japanese but anger at the wasted expense they have already had to bear. But a pandemic would take the decision out of his hands—not least, says Nakano Koichi of Sophia University, because the Olympic village would be “a cruise ship on land”. Bet on a postponement of the games at the very least, and on a long delay before the prime minister’s popularity shines again.

> 取消奥运会不仅仅会让日本民众失望，浪费掉的国家支出还会引发不得已承受财政负担的人们的愤怒。但疫情是他所决定不了的——特别是因为奥运村将会是个“岸上的游轮”，就同上智大学的中野浩一（Nakano Koichi）所说的那样。几乎可以肯定，奥运会至少会被推迟，首相安倍晋三也要很久之后才能重新变得那么受欢迎。
