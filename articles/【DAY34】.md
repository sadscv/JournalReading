1 “What is civilisation?” asked Kenneth Clark 50 years ago in the seminal bbc series on the subject. “I don’t know, and I can’t define it in abstract terms, yet. But I think I can recog- nise it when I see it, and I’m looking at it now.” And he turned to gesture behind him, at the soaring Gothic towers and flying buttresses of Notre Dame.

> 50 年前，肯尼斯·克拉克 (Kenneth Clark) 在著名的 BBC《文明的轨迹》节目中问道：“什么是文明？我不知道，我现在无法给一个抽象的定义。但我知道当我看到文明时一定能认出来，现在，文明就在我眼前。”他转身指向身后，巴黎圣母院那高耸的哥特式塔身和飞拱映入眼帘。

2It seems inhuman to care more about a building than about people. That the sight of Notre Dame going up in flames (see Eu- rope section) has attracted so much more attention than floods in southern Africa which killed over 1,000 arouses understand- able feelings of guilt. Yet the widespread, intense grief at the sight of the cathedral’s collapsing steeple is in fact profoundly human—and in a particularly 21st-century way.

> 相比人类同胞的安危，一座建筑反而引发更多关注，似乎毫无人性。 1000 多人在南非洪灾中丧生，而巴黎圣母院火灾却引发更多关注，有些罪恶感是可以理解的。不过，眼见巴黎圣母院塔尖倒塌，广大民众悲痛万分，实则充分彰显了人性，而且具有 21 世纪的鲜明特色。

3It is not just the economy that is global today, it is culture too. People wander the world in search not just of jobs and security but also of beauty and history. Familiarity breeds affection. A building on whose sunny steps you have rested, in front of which you have taken a selfie with your loved one, becomes a warm part of your memories and thus of yourself. That helps explain why China is in mourning—WeChat, young China’s principal means of talking to itself, has been throbbing with the story, and Xi Jinping, the country’s president, sent a message of condolence to Emmanuel Macron, his French counterpart—while India was largely indifferent. Tourism from India to the West is a trickle compared with the flood from China.

> 如今，经济实现了全球化，文化亦然。人们辗转世间，为的不仅是养家糊口、安全度日，更要走遍名胜，访遍古迹。人们对熟悉的事物往往富有感情。你曾在它洒满阳光的台阶上歇脚，也曾在它面前留下和爱人的自拍，这座建筑便成为你心中最温暖的回忆，也因此与你融为一体。这么说来，难怪中国举国悲恸——巴黎圣母院起火的新闻在微信霸屏（微信是新兴的中国人分享交流的主要工具）——而印度的情况就大为不同了。与中国浩浩荡荡的游客相比，赴法旅游的印度游客如九牛一毛。

4This visual age has endowed beauty with new power, and social media have turned great works of art into superstars. Only a few, though, have achieved this status. Just as there is only ever a handful of world-famous actors, so the pantheon of globally recognisable cultural symbols is tiny: the Mona Lisa (see Books & arts section), Michelangelo’s David, the Taj Mahal, the Great Pyr- amid—and Notre Dame. Disaster, too, is visual. In the 24 hours after the fire started videos on social media of the burning cathedral were viewed nearly a quarter of a billion times.

> 视觉时代赋予了美丽以新的力量。由于社交媒体的传播，伟大的艺术作品成为了超级明星。不过仅有少数能获此殊荣，就像扬名世界的演员从来都屈指可数。世界公认的文化象征寥寥无几：《蒙娜丽莎》、米开朗琪罗的《大卫》、泰姬陵、金字塔，还有巴黎圣母院。视觉时代也将灾难呈现在我们眼前。起火之后的 24 小时内，巴黎圣母院着火的视频在社交媒体上的播放量近 2.5亿次。

5Yet the emotions the sight aroused were less about the building itself than about what losing it might mean. Notre Dame is an expression of humanity at its collective best. Nobody could look up into that vaulted ceiling without wondering at the cumulative genius of the thousands of anonymous craftsmen who, over a century and a half, realised a vision so grand in its structural ambition and so delicate in its hand-chiselled detail. Its survival through 850 years of political turbulence—through war, revolution and Nazi occupation—binds the present to the past.

> 不过，人们目睹灾难后与其说是在哀悼巴黎圣母院本身，不如说是在哀叹失去它会意味着什么。巴黎圣母院凝结了众家匠心，反映出人性的光辉。所有人抬头看到圆拱穹顶都会不禁感叹，数千位无名匠人的天才智慧都凝结于此，他们历时一个半世纪，构建出气势磅礴的建筑架构，也展现出精美绝伦的手工雕花。它历经 850 年政治动荡仍屹立不倒，见证了战火、革命，挺过纳粹侵略，为当今世界刻下历史烙印。

6The fire also binds people to each other. The outpouring of emotion it has brought forth is proof that, despite the dark forces of division now abroad, we are all in it together. When nationalism is a rising threat, shared sadness makes borders suddenly irrelevant. When politics is polarised, a love of culture has the power to unite. When extremism divides Muslim from Christian and religious people from atheists, those of all faiths and none are mourning together. An edifice built for the glory of God also represents the unity of the human spirit.

> 这场大火也将人们彼此相连。大火后哀悼之声四起，证明尽管如今黑暗分裂势力在外涌动，但我们仍携手共进。虽然民族主义威胁日益加剧，在人们共同的悲伤面前，国界突然无关紧要。虽然政治日趋多极化，对文化的热爱仍为实现人类团结贡献强大的力量。虽然极端主义将穆斯林与基督教徒、宗教人群与无教主义者分离开来，但无论是否怀有信仰，所有人都一起默哀。巴黎圣母院本为纪念上帝的光辉而建，但同时也都是人类精神团结的标识。

7And it will be rebuilt. The morning after the fire, the many Parisians who went to the cathedral to mourn its destruction found comfort instead. Although the spire is gone, the towers are still standing and it seems likely that the whole building can be revived. The effort to rebuild it, like the fire, will bring people together. Within 24 hours, €600m ($677m) had been raised from businesses and rich people, and a rash of crowdfunding campaigns started. A high-resolution laser scan of the building, carried out recently, should help.

> 巴黎圣母院也将重建。火灾后第二天一早，当晚在巴黎圣母院前为其损毁默哀祈祷的巴黎群众又重新得到安慰。虽然塔尖已逝，但几座塔身仍然屹立着，整座建筑很有可能浴火重生。而就像火灾面前大家共同默哀一样，协力重建巴黎圣母院也会将人们团结在一起。24 小时内，各大公司和富裕人士就已经捐出 6 亿欧元（6.77 亿美元），一大批众筹项目也已启动。最近整座建筑经过高分辨率激光扫描这应该也有助重建。

8It will never be the same, but that is as it should be. As Victor Hugo wrote in “The Hunchback of Notre Dame”, a three-volume love-letter to the cathedral: “Great edifices, like great mountains, are the work of centuries. Art is often transformed as it is being made...Time is the architect, the nation is the builder.”

> 巴黎圣母院将不再是昔日模样，而也应当如此。正如维克多·雨果在《巴黎圣母院》中，写给巴黎圣母院的那三卷情书那样：“伟大的建筑与伟大的山脉一样，需要几个世纪的打磨。艺术在创作之中往往会改变模样…时间是建筑师，民族是搬砖人。”
